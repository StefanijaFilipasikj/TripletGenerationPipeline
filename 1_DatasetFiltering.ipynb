Similar to the first case, she was initially empirically treated (unsuccessfully) as presumed adult-onset asthma. CT showed left main bronchus stenosis with segmental atelectasis of the left upper lobe (Fig. ) while bronchoscopy revealed bronchomalacia with fibrostenosis at the distal end of left main bronchus. Rigid bronchoscopy was arranged for balloon dilatation of stenotic segment followed by TMC using the same method and dosage as described in previous cases. She reported initial improvements of symptoms which lasted for approximately two months. Repeated bronchoscopy revealed restenosis of the left main bronchus. She was then offered for evaluation for potential surgical treatment in which she declined. Fortunately, she remained stable on outpatient clinic follow-ups despite physical limitations (Modified Borg Dyspnoea Scale 3 at rest: moderate; similar to initial presentation).\",\n          \"Case 13 was a 27-year-old Caucasian male with FXS mosaicism with 40% of his cells carrying the premutation of 104 CGG repeats, and the rest with a full mutation with partial methylation. His IQ at age 25 on the Stanford Binet showed a verbal IQ of 63, nonverbal of 60, and full scale IQ of 60. In his childhood he was anxious and socially awkward and he did well with atypical antipsychotics including aripiprazole and risperidone in addition to sertraline and topiramate. At age 24 he developed an oral motor dystonia with spasms of his tongue which made his speech unintelligible. He also developed a neck twisting movement. His risperidone was tapered without improvement of his symptoms and he was treated with a variety of medications including carbidopa/levodopa, and lamotrigine without effect, but he later improved with clonazepam and guanfacine.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"age\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 239,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[[65.0, 'year']]\",\n          \"[[33.0, 'year']]\",\n          \"[[55.0, 'year']]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gender\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"F\",\n          \"M\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevant_articles\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2060,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{'33645298': 1, '34138945': 1, '18625683': 1, '16178983': 1, '34539780': 1, '28745014': 1, '32720223': 1, '15818427': 1, '32197060': 1, '15181490': 1, '15293074': 1, '32317203': 1, '32318865': 1, '33923719': 1, '32425321': 1, '32703535': 1, '9018453': 1, '33371733': 2}\",\n          \"{'32247926': 1, '32239127': 1, '29266856': 1, '32305489': 1, '32652541': 1, '34373809': 2, '32763956': 1, '34943795': 1, '32114074': 1, '32211844': 1, '32224151': 1, '32192580': 1, '32302954': 1, '32179140': 1, '23024711': 1, '32247826': 1, '31470887': 1, '32302078': 1, '32179659': 1, '33043303': 1, '32423471': 1, '32303495': 1, '32675661': 1, '34584465': 1, '32561873': 1, '33986966': 2}\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similar_patients\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10494,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{'7749935-2': 2, '7749935-3': 2, '7749935-4': 2, '7749935-5': 2, '7749935-6': 2, '7749935-7': 2, '7749935-8': 2, '7749935-9': 2}\",\n          \"{'6304307-1': 2, '6304307-2': 2, '6304307-3': 2, '6304307-4': 2, '6304307-6': 2, '6946562-1': 1, '7994076-1': 1, '6814111-1': 1, '4672098-1': 1}\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":23}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["filtered_df.to_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/FINKI/WBS, IKT KG Project/data/patients_filtered.csv\")"],"metadata":{"id":"0e1uWFJRE9k1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
