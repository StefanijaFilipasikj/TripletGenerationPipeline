Developing a preference-sensitive plan with families through SDM is crucial to ensure the benefits from treatment are maximized. After presenting the four options mentioned above, the clinician should ask the patient to reflect on what motivated them to seek OIT in the first place and what are their expectations from treatment. In the example above, the presence of tree nuts such as cashew and pistachio in the family’s diet may make these foods a priority over milk or soy []. In older patients, treatment objectives are often shaped by past experiences of reaction, social limitations or missed opportunities attributed to the allergies []. For example, young adults will often prioritize allergens that prevent them from travelling or socializing.\\\\nThe relevance of allergy test results for prioritizing allergens again depends on patient’s personal goals. Some patients may feel more comfortable starting with “milder allergens” to test the water before moving on with other foods if well tolerated. Conversely, others may find starting with their most “severe” allergens will help them achieve their objectives faster and improve their quality of life. In the end, the main criteria for prioritizing food allergens should be their relevance for the patient or family.\\\\nWhat is the best approach to desensitize multiple foods?\\\\n(A) Include many foods in a multi-food OIT protocol, or (B) approach each food individually, in sequence.\\\\nPerforming OIT simultaneously for multiple foods has the benefit of reducing the number of cycles translating into reduced amount of time and personal/healthcare cost and could capitalize on young age and lower IgE, or current access to biologics [, , ].

In OIT, “cross-desensitization” is when desensitization with one allergen modulates clinical reactivity to a related cross-reactive allergen that is not included in the OIT mix.\\\\nDesensitization to cashew will generally provide at least partial protection for pistachio [–] and the same phenomenon is seen with walnut OIT for pecan [, ]. The opposite (i.e. pistachio OIT for cashew desensitization, and pecan OIT for walnut desensitization) has not been specifically studied in clinical trials but clinical practice does not suggest any difference.\\\\nFor some foods such as cereals and legumes, the extent of cross-desensitization is unclear. One option can be to adopt a sequential approach, starting with the main allergen from the group and performing OFC to related allergens once maintenance is achieved. The risk with this approach is that if there is no bystander desensitization, the patient will need to undergo subsequent OIT cycle for these foods. The other option is to include all potentially cross-reactive foods simultaneously in the treatment plan but this approach could needlessly increase the amount of food taken daily and affect treatment burden and long- term adherence.\\\\nAn alternative option could be to investigate cross-reactivity in vitro (ex: IgE inhibition assays) [–].

Building this type of collaborative approach poses specific challenges but the new structure and accelerated knowledge transfer could be seen as an investment that would ultimately benefit all patients in this area. Before initiating such endeavours, one important aspect to consider is whether the pediatrician has adequate motivation, training, infrastructure and multidisciplinary team support to perform OIT locally.

Three months post-CR, the patient presented with pain in the right axilla, extending to the thumb, index, middle fingers and median half of the ring finger. Hyperesthesia was present in the palm of the right hand, along the sensory distribution of the median nerve. The pain rapidly worsened and hampered daily activities involving the right upper limb. Clinical examination revealed the presence of an elongated hard mass, located on the proximal medial side of the right upper arm. There was also right thenar eminence atrophy, defective apposition of the right thumb and incomplete flexion of the index and middle fingers. The patient underwent a full-body PET-CT scan. This revealed abnormal FDG-avid activity in the anatomical location of the median nerve in the right upper arm (Fig. a i, ii). No other lesions were identified. MRI revealed enlargement of the median nerve with abnormal signal intensity after IV contrast administration (Fig. b i, ii). Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) examination showed normal protein and glucose levels, mature lymphocytes 2–3 cells/mm [] and absence of malignant cells. A bone marrow assessment showed no lymphomatous infiltration. Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and adenovirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were negative. Serology for hepatitis B and C virus was also negative. Electrophysiological studies showed reduced conduction velocities of the motor and sensory median nerve. A biopsy obtained from the right upper arm mass showed fragments of fibrous and neural tissue infiltrated by an abnormal population of cells resembling Burkitt lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed on these cells revealed positivity for CD20, CD10 and Ki67 100% (Fig. ) and negativity for CD3, CD5, Bcl2, Bcl6, TdT and cyclin D1 (not shown). The salvage therapy plan consisted of high-dose cytarabine and rituximab, 3 weekly for four cycles. After two cycles of salvage therapy, the patient showed a very good clinical response.

On exam he could not extend his thumb or any of his fingers and could only extend his wrist in a radial direction. Radiographs show an ulna fracture from the machete. He was taken to surgery the day of the injury and was found to have all extensor tendons lacerated except for the extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) and 10% of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB). The main trunk and two branches of the PIN were also lacerated. The depth of the wound ended at the ulna where there was an incomplete fracture representing arrest of the machete's path by the ulna.\\\\nIn terms of surgical technique, the wound was extended proximally and distally. The skin and subcutaneous adipose layer were elevated as flaps. Individual fascial compartments were incised for exposure. As tendons were found they were tagged in a modified Kessler fashion with 2.0 Ticron leaving the ends long for later repair. If the corresponding tendon could be found easily, this was also tagged and the sutures of the two tendon ends were clamped with a hemostat.\\\\nRepairs should be performed from deep to superficial so a superficial repair will not obstruct the repair of a deeper structure. In this case the PIN was the deepest structure that needed to be repaired. The nerve ends were dissected proximally and distally so that a tension free primary repair could be achieved with 8.0 nylon using 2.5x loupe magnification. Two sutures were placed for each nerve repair. Once the PIN was repaired the tendon lacerations were next addressed.\\\\nPrimary repairs were done of the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) of the middle and ring fingers, the abductor pollicis longus (APL), and the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU). Only one extensor tendon to the small finger was found and repaired. Most likely it was the extensor digiti minimi (EDM) and the patient lacked a small finger EDC. The EDC to the index was also repaired. We believed the extensor indicis proprius (EIP) tendon and muscle was uninjured since its origin was distal to the site of injury but there was no index finger extensor on exam because of the PIN had been lacerated. We believe the same applies to the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB).

He was unable to extend his thumb and small finger, and could only extend his wrist radially. Radiographs show a small piece of glass at the level of the injury. Intraoperatively, there were complete lacerations of the EPL, the small finger EDC, and the ECU. There was an incomplete laceration of the EDM. Also, the main trunk and two branches of the PIN were found to be transected. There was also an incomplete fracture of the ulna from the glass.\\\\nThe EPL was injured very proximal at the musculotendinous junction so there was no tendon proper proximally. 2.0 Ticron was placed in a figures-of-eight fashion, proximally in muscle and any available fascial tissue including intramuscular septae. The EPL injury was deep to the nerve injury so this was repaired first. Next, the main trunk of the PIN which was 2 mm in diameter was repaired with 8.0 nylon. The two smaller branches were repaired with 9.0 nylon. The main trunk and one of the smaller branches was under some tension despite mobilization of the nerves proximally and distally. Thus, a type I collagen nerve wrap (NeuroMend, Stryker Orthopaedics, Mahwah, New Jersey) was placed around these two repairs. Due to the musculotendinous level of injury of the small finger EDC and EDM, multiple figure-of-eight 0.0 Ticron sutures were placed into any tendon substance available but proximally there was only muscle substance. The ECU had tendon available proximal and distal to the level of the injury so 0.0 Ticron was used in a modified Kessler fashion supplemented with a horizontal mattress.\\\\nPostoperatively, he was placed in a splint with the wrist in 20 degrees of extension and the fingers and thumb in extension for 2 weeks.

In this case, the right adrenal gland was removed, because adrenal venous sampling revealed that cortisol production from the right gland was much greater than from the left (right: 38.9μg/dL; left: 20.3μg/dL).\\\\nThe surgical procedures and results are summarized in Table . The duration of the operations for patients 1 and 2 included the time required to change the patient’s position. The estimated blood loss was for patient 1 was 350mL and negligible in the others. All patients were able to walk and receive oral nutrient intake by post-operative day 2. Hydrocortisone was administered intravenously to patients 1 and 2 starting on the day of the operation. The drug was administered orally after the patients stared taking meals orally. The dose was tapered to 15 or 20mg/day until discharge, which prolonged the length of their hospitalization. No conversions to open surgery were performed, and no severe complications occurred during the post-operative period.\\\\nClinical courses and outcomes are summarized in Table . Clinical improvements, such as disappearance of moon face, central obesity, and muscle weakness were evident in patients 1, 2, and 3.

The renal symptoms typically consisted of mild proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and hypertension\\\\n[-]. More than 50% of patients had mild renal failure\\\\n[-]. Nephrotic syndrome, nephritic syndrome, and acute kidney injury (AKI) have been reported in 20%, 14–25%, and 9% of patients, respectively\\\\n[,]. Fluid overload, oliguria, and metabolic disorders may require urgent renal replacement therapy, as illustrated by our second case\\\\n[,].

Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis and focal and segmental glomerulonephritis also have been described\\\\n[,-]. Renal failure may also result from nonglomerular lesions due to heart failure, sepsis, or hemorrhagic shock. The main short-term complications are AKI, oliguria, fluid overload with acute respiratory distress, and metabolic disorders. End-stage renal disease requiring long-term dialysis occurs in less than 15–30% of patients, and only after a course of 10 years in half of the cases\\\\n[,]. In a retrospective study of 105 patients with CV-related nephropathy and a mean disease duration of 11 years, factors predicting end-stage renal failure were age >50 years, splenomegaly, cryocrit >10%, low C3 level, recurrent purpura, initial serum creatinine >136 μmol/L, and HIV coinfection\\\\n[].

A prompt improvement was noted with resolution of the purpura and partial recovery of renal function. Pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin therapy decreased the HCV load to undetectable levels. The cyclophosphamide was discontinued and the prednisone tapered.\\\\nLung involvement in CV is mainly characterized by subclinical alveolitis, which occasionally leads to interstitial lung fibrosis\\\\n[,]. Although only scarce data are available in the literature, patent pulmonary involvement has been associated with poor survival in patients with CV\\\\n[]. In the series by Ramos-Casals et al., the mortality rate reached 100% for patients with pulmonary hemorrhage\\\\n[]. Acute severe pulmonary manifestations in patients with CV include (1) pulmonary edema, due to fluid overload caused by kidney and heart failure, (2) bronchopulmonary and systemic infections, (3) diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and (4) hyperviscosity-related pulmonary lesions. Infections, although not specific of CV, may be precipitated by immunodeficiency related to the underlying disorder (most notably hematological malignancies) and drugs used to treat CV (steroids and immunosuppressive agents)\\\\n[-,]. Retrospective studies indicate that infections are among the leading causes of death in patients with CV, after cardiovascular events\\\\n[,-]. Acute respiratory distress is usually related to renal and/or heart failure with fluid overload and pulmonary edema, rather than to specific lung lesions, namely, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and hyperviscosity-related pulmonary lesions\\\\n[,,,,,,-]. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was the most common reason for ICU admission of patients with small-vessel vasculitis in the retrospective series of Khan et al., although none of the 28 patients displayed CV\\\\n[]. Patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage generally present with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure or hemoptysis and anemia\\\\n[,-]. Chest radiography and CT show diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, suggesting ongoing alveolitis\\\\n[,-]. When performed, bronchoscopy usually reveals blood in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The pathological examination may reveal intraalveolar red blood cells, fibrin, and eventually hemosiderin-laden macrophages, which may take up to 48 or 72 h to accumulate\\\\n[,]. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is associated with a wide spectrum of disorders, including systemic vasculitis and connective tissue disease\\\\n[]. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage occurs in less than 5% of patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia, irrespective of HCV status, and is generally associated with CV-related glomerulonephritis\\\\n[-]. Therefore, CV should be on the list of differential diagnoses of pulmonary-renal syndrome\\\\n[,]. Our case contrasts with other reported cases, because diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is usually associated with a poor outcome\\\\n[]. It is worth noting that the lung manifestations occurred shortly after the administration of rituximab, a drug whose reported adverse events include interstitial pneumonitis\\\\n[-].

The troponin level was slightly increased (0.13 μg/L, N < 0.02 μg/L), and the electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversion with normal ST segments. Endotracheal ventilation was started. Community-acquired pneumonia was suspected and empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated. The patient also received bronchodilators and oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day for 5 days). She improved and was extubated. However, she experienced an episode of abdominal pain and acute anemia (7.5 g/dL). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a cardial ulcer with no active bleeding. Skin ulcers developed over the legs, as well as nephrotic syndrome with peripheral edema and microscopic hematuria but no renal failure.\\\\nThe diagnosis was HCV-related type II cryoglobulinemia involving the skin, joints, and kidneys, and probably the gut. Steroid therapy was resumed. Acute respiratory distress developed rapidly. The electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversion with normal ST segments. Endotracheal ventilation was initiated. A skin rash with purpura was noted after the administration of cold serum to measure cardiac output during Swan-Ganz catheter insertion. Echocardiography showed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contained 26·104 cells/mL with 3.5% neutrophils and no hemosiderin-laden alveolar macrophages. Cultures were negative. The creatinine serum level increased to 127 μmol/l. Urinalysis showed hematuria and proteinuria in the nephrotic range. The diagnosis was respiratory failure due to CV-related heart failure precipitated by hypertensive crisis and renal involvement. Plasma exchanges were initiated in addition to symptomatic treatment. Replacement liquids were warmed before administration. Four weekly rituximab infusions (375 mg/m²/week) were administered. Ribavirin was added to pegylated interferon alfa-2a to control chronic HCV infection. The skin lesions resolved and the renal function recovered. Coronary angiography performed a few weeks later showed normal coronary arteries, suggesting involvement of the coronary microcirculation, which was consistent with CV-related heart involvement.\\\\nCV-related cardiac disease is a rare but life-threatening manifestation of CV\\\\n[,,,-]. Systemic disease with respiratory distress and renal involvement is usually present in patients with CV-related cardiac disease. Acute cardiac involvement should be distinguished from long-term cardiovascular complications, which are among the leading causes of death in patients with CV\\\\n[,,,,,]. Moreover, the previous cardiovascular status should be considered\\\\n[]. CV-related cardiac disease usually occurs concomitantly with other severe organ manifestations\\\\n[,]. Heart dysfunction with pulmonary edema is the main presentation. As reported in our patients, echocardiography may reveal diastolic and systolic dysfunction with low cardiac output and segmental dyskinesia or akinesia. Precipitating factors include: AKI; hypertensive crisis, which is usually severe and controllable only by using multiple antihypertensive medications; and coronary heart disease\\\\n[,]. Coronary heart disease is difficult to assess in patients with CV, because typical chest pain is not always present. The manifestations may consist only in mild troponin elevation or subtle changes in T waves or ST segments. CV-related coronary heart disease usually involves the coronary microcirculation, sparing the major arteries, which are usually normal by angiography\\\\n[].

Urinalysis showed nephrotic-range proteinuria and hematuria, and the renal biopsy disclosed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. By abdominal CT, she had mild thickening of the left colonic wall consistent with ischemic colitis. Empirical antibiotics and three daily intravenous methylprednisolone pulses (1,000 mg/day) followed by prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) were administered. Her condition improved, and the steroids were tapered. Two weeks later, she experienced recurrent severe abdominal pain with high-grade fever. She was rapidly transferred to the ICU. Early colonoscopy showed numerous lesions of different ages, some of which were deep ulcerations without perforation, consistent with ischemic colitis. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. Repeated physical examination demonstrated mild tenderness and peritoneal irritation over the left side of the lower abdomen. Emergency laparotomy revealed stercoral perforation of the colon. Colectomy followed by colostomy was performed. The pathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of CV-related ischemic colitis (Figure\\\\n). In the meantime, mild dyspnea and a bilateral pleural effusion developed. The electrocardiogram and troponin levels were unchanged. Echocardiography indicated severe left ventricular dysfunction with septal akinesia. The diagnosis was a CV flare involving the skin, gut, kidneys, and heart. Intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy (500 mg/m²) was added to the steroids and symptomatic treatment. A prompt improvement was noted, with resolution of the dyspnea and pleural effusion. She was discharged. Secondary bowel anastomosis was performed a few months later.

His family reported that his speech was pressured, and that he had begun wandering about without seeming to know where he was going. He also had outbursts of anger and exhibited destructive behavior as well. After burning newspapers at home and threatening his family, he was sent to the emergency room and was then admitted to the psychiatric ward.\\\\nHis medical history indicated that he had been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder at age 22 and had been hospitalized several times for treatment of manic episodes. He had been followed up at our clinic since he was 37 years of age. At age 49, he presented manic symptoms, including hyperactivity, incomprehensible speech, talking to himself, uncontrollable emotional outbursts, and destructive acts. After admission, he continued to have disorganized speech patterns, distractibility, and agitation. He exhibited grandiosity, had auditory and visual hallucinations, and showed occasional catatonia-like signs of excessive motor movement, purposeless walking around with mundane postures, and inexplicably squatting at corners. Because of his severe and worsening disorientation and marked inattention, a diagnosis of delirium and bipolar mania was entertained. Results of a detailed physical examination were unremarkable. No fever was detected and his blood pressure was normal. Vitamin B12 and folic acid levels were within normal ranges, and his electroencephalograms were normal. As a result, the diagnosis was changed to delirious mania. The physician proposed ECT, but the patient’s family refused it.\\\\nThe patient was placed on a regimen of haloperidol decanoate, 50 mg/wk; valproate, 1500 mg/day (level: 53.89 mEq/L to 95.35 mEq/L); lithium carbonate, 600 mg/day (level: 0.35-0.74 mEq/L); trihexyphenidyl, 10 mg, and chlorprothexine, 100 mg/day. In addition, flunitrazepam, 2-4 mg/day, was given for severe insomnia throughout the patient’s hospitalization, with episodic augmentation of dormicum, 15 mg/day, and trazodone, 100 mg/day. Clonazepam, 4-10 mg/day, was prescribed for agitation. We considered decreasing the dosage of the antipsychotics, to avoid neurotoxicity, but this became impossible because the patient became ever more agitated and had to be restrained for longer periods.\\\\nAbout 15 days after he was admitted, we noticed he had general weakness, and replaced clonazepam with lorazepam, 1-7 mg/day, according to the severity of agitation. During this period, 2-4 mg of lorazepam was injected intramuscularly nine times for controlling his aggressive agitation from day 2 to day 33. After day 33, chlorpromazine, 25-50 mg, was injected intramuscularly three times for aggressive agitation because lorazepam had produced only a limited effect. Trihexyphenidyl, 10 mg/day, was used before admission and continued because of concern about the increased risk of the extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS). The patient had no obvious symptoms of EPS. Constipation was observed episodically, so 24 mg/day of sennoside was given initially and then replaced by dulcolax, 10 mg/day. On the 71st day after admission, the patient was discharged without full remission. This occurred against his clinicians’ advice, but his family thought he had been hospitalized too long and they felt he seemed less agitated. His discharge medications remained the same, with the exception of the addition of oral haloperidol, 15 mg/day. His symptoms remitted about 2 weeks after discharge. His family claimed he took his medication as ordered after discharge.\\\\nAt the latest admission, the patient’s manic behavior warranted close monitoring and frequent seclusion. His speech was rambling and pressured. His mood was elevated, and he was distracted, hostile. He impulsively and inappropriately touched other patients but not in a sexual manner and had urinary and fecal incontinence. He occasionally walked around aimlessly and once more squatted at corners purposelessly, which seemed to be catatonia-like signs. His delirium was worsening, with disorientation as to time and place. All this made his medical care very difficult.\\\\nThe results of laboratory studies, including thyroid function tests, were normal. Physical examination showed no signs of inflammation or infection. The patient’s vital signs were normal. The clinical impression was delirious mania. The family once more refused ECT.\\\\nIn an attempt to control his behavior, valproate (level: 66.44 mEq/L to 105.29 mEq/L), and lithium carbonate (level: 0.81 mEq/L to 1.16 mEq/L), were used concurrently with augmentation of his antipsychotic medication. The dose was titrated to maintain the valproate level at around 100 mEq/L and lithium at 1 mEq/L for expected maximal therapeutic effect. Trazodone, 100 mg/day, and lorazepam, 4 mg/day, were administered for their hypnotic effect. In addition, the antipsychotics were immediately started after the patient was readmitted. The initial agent selected was olanzapine (15 mg for 5 days), and this was then changed to quetiapine (50 mg for 3 days) and zotepine (100 mg to 200 mg for 1 month) in order to make him slightly sleepy. The manic symptoms gradually improved: Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score declined from 42 (on day 9), peaked at 46 (day 16), then fell to 20 (day 30), and remained between 15-24. The patient’s YMRS score was 15 at discharge, but his delirium did not resolve. He seemed sleepy most of the time, but was episodically agitated and uncooperative with his treatment. His inattention and agitation made oral intake difficult and led to frequent choking. Nasopharyngeal tube feeding was sometimes needed. The hypoactivity with his sleepy state and slightly rigid limbs made catatonia and EPS difficult to rule out. But he had neither other catatonic symptoms such as echolalia nor hypertension and fever. Concern about EPS, catatonia, and anticholinergic-induced delirium led us to change the zotepine to quetiapine (400 mg to 500 mg for the remaining month) and to reduce the trihexyphenidyl dosage, from the initial 10 mg/day to 2 mg/day for the remainder of his hospitalization. At the same time, lorazepam was injected intramuscularly for agitation control, at a dosage of 1 mg/day (given one time) and 2 mg/day, given seven times from day 2 to day 77.\\\\nFor financial reasons, the family arranged to have the patient transferred to another hospital. At discharge, he still had occasional delirium but he was much more cooperative with staff members. Two months later, he returned to our clinic, and was in near-remission but he had no clear memory about his treatment at the other hospital and thus couldn’t provide any information about the regimen at the other hospital.', 'patient_id': '3503657-1', 'age': \"[[53.0, 'year']]\", 'gender': 'M', 'sentences': ['53-year-old male', 'Bipolar I disorder', 'Manic episodes', 'Hyperactivity', 'Incomprehensible speech', 'Anger outbursts', 'Destructive behavior', 'Psychiatric ward', 'Family members', 'Age 22', 'Age 37', 'Age 49', 'Delirium', 'Bipolar mania', 'ECT', 'Haloperidol', 'Valproate', 'Lithium carbonate', 'Trihexyphenidyl', 'Chlorprothexine', 'Flunitrazepam', 'Dormicum', 'Trazodone', 'Clonazepam', 'Lorazepam', 'Chlorpromazine', 'Olanzapine', 'Quetiapine', 'Zotepine', 'Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)']}\n","Finished report 2633\n","********************\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p'].

His treatment regimen included lithium carbonate, 1500 mg/day, carbamazepine, 600 mg/day; haloperidol, 2 mg to 5 mg/day (titrated as needed); and trihexyphenidyl, 5 mg/day. His performance at work had deteriorated for several months prior to admission. Six weeks prior to admission, he began to show emotional lability, talking to himself, laughing hysterically, and exhibiting unusual behavior, such as remaining naked for an inappropriately long time after bathing. He presented at an outpatient clinic, displaying mania and was in a generally disorganized condition. Both delirium and dementia were suspected. His medication was adjusted at the clinic after symptoms developed, so this ruled out drug-induced delirium. After receiving 150 mg of zuclopenthixol, he showed general weakness and disorientation at night. Four days prior to admission, he had been treated with risperidone, 4 mg, and carbamazepine, 200 mg, because it was felt that the EPS might have been induced by use of traditional antipsychotics. He was finally admitted to the hospital because of irritability, loose associations, and talking to himself.\\\\nThe bipolar disorder could be traced back to age 29, when his manic behavior led to hospitalization for 1 month. During that episode, disorientation was also noted. His wife denied any knowledge that he had abused substances in the past.\\\\nOn admission, the patient presented with mixed symptoms of delirium and mania. He was inattentive, disorientated as to time, place, and person, and unable to find his bed. He was awake all night, busy without clear goals, spoke incoherently and had decreased appetite and intake. He took boxing stances and pumped his thigh at times without reason, showing catatonia-like symptoms. Electroencephalographic (EEG) results showed poor alpha waves and mild cortical dysfunction. The neurologist thought this was a normal pattern frequently seen in aging patients and indicated no specific illness. A computed tomography (CT) scan indicated an “aging brain,” with mild ventricular dilatation and mild widening of the cortical sulci. Vitamin B12 and folic acid levels were within normal ranges. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were also within normal limits, while free thyroxine (T4) levels were slightly lower than normal (0.69 ng/dL; normal range: 0.7-1.48 ng/dL). Delirious mania was considered the cause for his delirium because there was no acute precipitating physical illness. His family refused the suggestion of ECT because they were not familiar with it.\\\\nAfter this, the patient was treated with risperidone, 4 mg/day, and valproate, 500 mg to 1000 mg/day (level: 98.28 μg/mL). On about the sixth day of treatment, he became oriented. The manic picture became much clearer in the following days. On the 11th day, lithium, 300 mg to 900 mg/day, was titrated up because the patient had gone several consecutive nights without sleep. On the 15th day, quetiapine, 600 mg/day, replaced risperidone (4 mg/day) for his insomnia. When daytime drowsiness occurred for 2 consecutive days, quetiapine was then replaced by olanzapine, 20 mg/day. For insomnia, estazolam, 4 mg, or flunitrazepam, 2 mg, was used, depending on the severity of the insomnia. But lorazepam, 2 mg/day, was given 3 times, and zolpidem, 10 mg/day, or zopiclone, 15 mg/day, was administered 17 times more episodically as the patient’s insomnia worsened. The patient was discharged in partial remission about 1 month later because the family chose to care for him at home.

A week later he had insomnia, confusion, an unsteady gait, and frequent falls. On the day of admission, he was found kneeling in the street.\\\\nThe patient had a history of peptic ulcer, pyloric stenosis, gallstones, and adhesive ileus that had been treated by vagotomy, gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, and enterolysis. His first episode of depression occurred at age 58. He was admitted twice for manic episodes, and the last psychiatric hospitalization was 5 years prior to this admission. His regular regimen included lithium carbonate, 600 mg/day; trihexyphenidyl, 2 mg/day; clonazepam, 3 mg/day; and diazepam, 4 mg/day.

Bupropion was discontinued immediately. Because of tongue dyskinesia, the olanzapine was changed to quetiapine, 400 mg/day. Three weeks later, delirium appeared. He became disoriented. He was frightened by visual hallucinations, and angry at the staff, whom he believed had transported him to “the train station.” His lithium level was 0.41 mEq/L to 1.18 mEq/L while he was hospitalized. His white blood cell count (WBC) was elevated to 18100/uL, Segment 83%, but there was no fever or evidence of infection. He had an inguinal hernia, which was believed to be the source of his leukocytosis, but the hernia could be moved in place by the surgeon without any sign of infection. Two weeks later, the WBC count decreased to 6900/uL without antibiotics. Thus, infection was ruled out as a possible cause for delirium. The results of electrolytes and renal and hepatic function tests were normal. Results of CT scans were unremarkable. On the 12th day, an abnormal EEG was recorded, with mild-to-moderate cortical dysfunction without epileptic findings. The patient’s delirium persisted, along with persecutory delusions, fear of eating, and with agitation, kicking, and shouting.

Given his refractory effusions, an indwelling pleural cavity drainage catheter was placed at an outside hospital 8 months prior to his orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for self-drainage of the effusion at home. The pleural catheter was removed 1 month after its placement when he was referred for OLT in order to minimize the chance of infectious complications.

Her mother, seeing nothing unusual in her\\\\n daughter's mouth, assumed she was having postnasal drainage from seasonal allergies\\\\n and gave her diphenhydramine. One hour later the girl was spitting saliva in a cup\\\\n and complaining of a tight throat and inability to swallow. The mother took her to\\\\n the ED. Initial questioning revealed there was no history of similar events and the\\\\n patient had neither insect-bite exposure nor new medications or foods in the prior\\\\n 24 hours. She had a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis with typical symptoms, but\\\\n no history of food or drug allergies. The patient took antihistamines as needed for\\\\n seasonal allergies and a multivitamin daily. She had been in the ED 2 months\\\\n previously because of intractable vomiting that began 6 hours after being hit in the\\\\n stomach by a soccer ball.\\\\nVital signs consisted of a blood pressure of 100/66 mm Hg, heart rate 100,\\\\n respirations 20, and 90% oxygen saturation on room air; she was afebrile. Physical\\\\n examination was normal with a few exceptions: her voice was hoarse, her head was\\\\n tilted forward, the posterior pharynx and uvula were edematous, and inspiratory\\\\n stridor was heard over the trachea. No facial, tongue, lip, or neck swelling or\\\\n cervical adenopathy or tenderness were noted.\\\\nOn arrival, the patient received oxygen supplementation, IV diphenhydramine HCl 50\\\\n mg, IV methylprednisolone 60 mg, and epinephrine (1:1000) 0.3 mL given\\\\n intramuscularly. The patient's symptoms did not change with these maneuvers.\\\\nLaboratory evaluation included a normal complete blood count and chemistry panel.\\\\n Chest x-ray was normal, however, soft-tissue lateral neck film revealed\\\\n straightening of the cervical spine with edema of the epiglottis and upper\\\\n airway.\\\\nThe mother subsequently revealed a family history of attacks of throat swelling,\\\\n episodic hand and foot swelling, and abdominal pain. Both the mother and a maternal\\\\n aunt had been diagnosed with HAE in their teenage years. The patient had recently\\\\n been found to have C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency consistent with a diagnosis of\\\\n HAE, although she had not had any apparent swelling attacks.\\\\nAfter the family history of HAE was revealed, the mother's physician was called. The\\\\n child had been diagnosed with type 1 HAE and enrolled in a clinical study for\\\\n treatment of attacks of HAE. Her laboratory results on entry to the study were C4 =\\\\n 4 mg/dL, C1-esterase inhibitor = 8 mg/dL, and functional C1-esterase inhibitor 22%.\\\\n Open-label study drug was provided by the physician. The patient was given 1000\\\\n units of nanofiltered C1-esterase inhibitor by IV infusion over 10 minutes. Within\\\\n 30 minutes, the patient was able to swallow.\\\\nIn light of this potentially life-threatening laryngeal HAE attack, the child's\\\\n physician prescribed routine prophylaxis with C1-esterase inhibitor concentrate.\\\\n Currently, the patient receives infusions of 1000 units of nanofiltered C1-esterase\\\\n inhibitor every 3 to 4 days. She has experienced no severe HAE swelling attacks\\\\n since beginning prophylactic therapy 1 year ago.\\\\nAlthough diagnosing HAE may be difficult because of variability in clinical\\\\n presentation, this case illustrates the importance of having a high level of\\\\n suspicion for HAE in patients presenting with characteristic symptoms, especially in\\\\n the presence of a positive family history[]. It is recommended that symptom-free children with a positive family\\\\n history have an initial screening (including complement tests) at the age of 6\\\\n months and again at 1 year of age[].\\\\nPatients experiencing laryngeal edema often complain of tightness of the throat,\\\\n inability to clear saliva, and dysphagia. Patients may also have edema of the soft\\\\n palate or tongue, making swallowing and breathing difficult[]. Because laryngeal edema can be fatal, prompt treatment is\\\\n essential[]. As seen with this patient,\\\\n misdiagnosis of HAE symptoms is common. Standard therapies for allergy-mediated\\\\n angioedema (eg, epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines) are not effective\\\\n in treating HAE symptoms because HAE manifestations are mediated by bradykinin\\\\n whereas angioedema caused by allergic reactions is mediated by histamine and other\\\\n mediators[]. In this case, the patient's\\\\n laryngeal edema did not respond to standard therapies for an allergic reaction. This\\\\n case also highlights the need for patient and caregiver education about HAE symptoms\\\\n and emergency care procedures. Although the mother was diagnosed with HAE and was\\\\n aware her child had a C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency, there were delays in\\\\n obtaining medical attention and in providing family and patient history to medical\\\\n personnel.\\\\nLong-term prophylaxis is indicated for patients who experience frequent or severe\\\\n attacks, laryngeal attacks, have significant anxiety or poor quality of life as a\\\\n result of HAE, or have limited access to emergency medical care[]. The fact that this patient has not\\\\n experienced severe HAE swelling attacks since beginning prophylactic therapy\\\\n underscores the value of this therapy in the management of HAE.

Clinical findings, a positive family history\\\\n (the patient's mother died of suffocation from laryngeal edema at the age of 32),\\\\n and the results of complement testing (C4: 0.02 g/L [normal 0.15 to 0.55 g/L];\\\\n C1-esterase inhibitor antigenic level: 0.03 g/L [normal 0.15 to 0.3 g/L];\\\\n C1-esterase inhibitor functional activity: 18% [normal 70 to 100%]; C1q: 118 mg/L\\\\n [normal 60 to 180 mg/L]) confirmed the diagnosis of type I HAE. The patient was\\\\n enrolled in a follow-up program with 2 prescheduled control visits each year.\\\\nAt the age of 13, the frequency and severity of edematous episodes increased. Attacks\\\\n recurred on 2 or 3 occasions per month and an abdominal attack occurred. The\\\\n increased frequency of attacks was attributed to the physiological hormonal changes\\\\n of puberty. A trial of prophylactic therapy with tranexamic acid was ineffective,\\\\n and therefore, danazol 200 mg daily was introduced. This relieved symptoms\\\\n considerably, with the number of attacks decreasing to as low as 2 to 3 extremity\\\\n attacks and 1 abdominal attack per year. The patient tolerated pharmacotherapy well.\\\\n Adverse effects included transient episodes of irregular menses and headache, but\\\\n these were not severe enough to warrant discontinuation of treatment. The dose of\\\\n danazol was reduced to 100 mg every other day.\\\\nAn unplanned pregnancy occurred at the age of 23 and danazol was discontinued. This\\\\n was followed by a dramatic increase in attack frequency; edematous episodes recurred\\\\n 2 to 3 times per week and 80% of the attacks were of the combined type (severe\\\\n abdominal attack with extremity edema). Laryngeal edema developed on a single\\\\n occasion. C1-esterase inhibitor administered during attacks was effective; it\\\\n mitigated symptoms within 15 to 30 minutes. Thus, intermittent C1-esterase inhibitor\\\\n prophylaxis was introduced in the eighth week of gestation. Administration of 500 IU\\\\n C1-esterase inhibitor twice a week achieved near-complete elimination of symptoms,\\\\n with only 1 episode of mild extremity edema that occurred after mechanical trauma.\\\\n The patient did not experience any adverse reactions to therapy. After the 12th week\\\\n of pregnancy, the dose of C1-esterase inhibitor was reduced to 500 IU weekly and\\\\n then, as the patient had become symptom-free, C1-esterase inhibitor prophylaxis was\\\\n discontinued at week 15. The patient gave birth by vaginal delivery to a healthy\\\\n neonate during the 38th week of gestation; the child has not inherited HAE. Although\\\\n no edema developed during delivery, C1-esterase inhibitor was kept at hand.\\\\n Long-term prophylaxis was not necessary during the 2-month lactation period. Several\\\\n instances of mild subcutaneous edema and a single abdominal attack occurred; the\\\\n latter responded to acute treatment with 500 IU of C1-esterase inhibitor.

Subsequently,\\\\n however, increasing attack frequency and severity (with no identifiable cause)\\\\n required the reintroduction of danazol prophylaxis. Currently, the patient is on\\\\n danazol 100 mg every other day.\\\\nThis case illustrates that long-term prophylaxis of HAE does not necessarily mean\\\\n uninterrupted drug therapy over a lifetime. During regularly scheduled check-ups,\\\\n the therapeutic regimen can be modified: drugs may be discontinued, others may be\\\\n introduced, and dosages may be adjusted. In this case, tranexamic acid was\\\\n ineffective, and therefore, switching to danazol was necessary. Titration to the\\\\n lowest effective dose (in this patient from the daily 200-mg initial dose to 100 mg\\\\n every other day) is recommended to avoid or at least mitigate adverse effects[].\\\\nPrecipitating factors such as stress, trauma, infection, menstruation, and pregnancy\\\\n have been reported to contribute to the frequency of HAE attacks[,,,,]. Short-term prophylactic\\\\n treatment, also referred to as procedural prophylaxis, is advised for patients with\\\\n a planned exposure to a situation that may trigger an attack, such as dental work or\\\\n invasive medical procedures[,]. The care of pregnant women, however, is\\\\n complicated by the potential adverse effects of attenuated androgens on the\\\\n developing fetus[]. In this patient, danazol\\\\n was discontinued when she became pregnant and attack frequency increased\\\\n dramatically. Recent consensus guidelines proposed that C1-esterase inhibitor is the\\\\n safest prophylactic agent during pregnancy[]. In this patient, intermittent prophylaxis with C1-esterase inhibitor\\\\n during pregnancy proved a safe and effective therapy.

The\\\\n patient presented with recurrent intermittent bouts of abdominal pain. These\\\\n episodes, which began at 8 years of age, are described as crampy discomfort that\\\\n lasts for 3 to 4 days despite medications and resolve on their own. The patient was\\\\n diagnosed with HAE at 16 years of age after being hospitalized for a severe\\\\n abdominal episode. Initial treatment was with methyltestosterone, but this was\\\\n changed to stanozolol for greater efficacy. Stanozolol was switched to danazol 15\\\\n years ago; however, the patient began experiencing more frequent swelling episodes\\\\n and approximately 4 severe abdominal episodes a year while receiving danazol 200 mg\\\\n daily. Triggers for the attacks include upper respiratory infections, alcohol,\\\\n amoxicillin, pizza, and yeast rolls. The patient continued to take danazol 200 mg\\\\n daily, but experienced recurrent swelling of the hands and feet approximately 8 to\\\\n 10 times per year, with each episode lasting between 3 and 5 days. These episodes\\\\n were often mild and did not require medical attention. Laboratory values were\\\\n C1-esterase inhibitor of 5 mg/dL, functional C1-esterase inhibitor at 1%, C4 of 5\\\\n mg/dL, and normal AST and ALT. An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant was notable\\\\n for 3 small hepatic hemangiomata.\\\\nLong-term prophylactic therapy was changed to stanozolol 2 mg daily, which led to\\\\n less frequent abdominal attacks. The patient continued to have hand swelling, and\\\\n although the frequency of attacks was decreased, the patient missed work as a result\\\\n of the attacks. While taking stanozolol, AST and ALT increased to 48 and 71 IU/L,\\\\n respectively, blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein increased, and high-density\\\\n lipoprotein decreased. Therapy was changed to C1-esterase inhibitor 1000 units twice\\\\n a week. During the past 6 months, the patient has had 2 episodes of abdominal\\\\n swelling, which were less intense than his previous episodes.

His flight privileges were revoked upon discovery of the splenomegaly, and he took a part-time retail sales position. Past history was notable for persistent problems with episodic diffusely migratory musculoskeletal pain complaints since unexplained left shoulder bursitis at age 9; repeated evaluations of these episodes were non-diagnostic. In addition to his gastrointestinal/abdominal symptoms, review of systems also revealed a sense of frequent variation in body temperature, sometimes even with mild rigors; near daily night sweats; episodic diffusely migratory edema; pruritic erythematous rash about the inferior neck; occasional acute spells of severe diffuse pruritus; waxing/waning dysgeusia and dysosmia; chronic tinnitus; chronic fatigue to the point of inability to get out of bed on some mornings; unpredictable/unprovoked acute-onset episodes every few days to every few weeks of lightheadedness and flushing; frequent palpitations; chronically irritated eyes; marked gastroesophageal reflux (intolerant of esomeprazole but improved with ranitidine); chronic back pain and diffusely migratory polyarthritis; alternating diarrhea and constipation; poor healing; and occasional diffusely migratory tingling/numbness paresthesias.\\\\nExamination was notable only for tenderness to palpation across the upper abdomen (worst in the epigastrium) and the above-noted neck rash but without pruritic behaviors. Small cherry angiomata were sparsely scattered about his skin. Moderate dermatographism was noted.\\\\nSerum tryptase was normal. Upon finding an elevated urinary prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) level during an “attack” plus increased (but non-aggregated, non-spindled) MCs by bright CD117 immunohistochemical staining in multiple gastrointestinal (GI) tract mucosal biopsies, MCAS was diagnosed. He gained incremental improvement with loratadine and famotidine and then aspirin, then quickly proved intolerant of serial trials of clonazepam, lorazepam, doxepin, quercetin, ketotifen, cromolyn, montelukast, and low-dose imatinib (200 mg daily), and then gained further improvement with low-dose dasatinib at 40 mg daily. Waxing/waning, diffusely migratory soft tissue and bone pain (typically 7/10 or worse) persisted without improvement, often was disabling, and proved refractory to a wide variety of analgesics prescribed by his local physicians. Hydrea-brand HU was begun in December 2011, initially at 500 mg daily, escalating weekly.\\\\nHe returned in February 2012, having reached the prescribed target dose of 1500 mg daily. He reported the drug had initially worsened his nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, headache, and malaise, but after a week these symptoms completely resolved and his diffuse soft tissue pain completely resolved, too. He was able to stop aspirin and other occasional use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\\\\nTwo weeks later he reported new dyspnea. Thorough cardiopulmonary evaluation was unrevealing. Dasatinib was stopped.\\\\nIn March 2012 soft tissue pain mildly relapsed, and HU had to be reduced to 500 mg daily due to excessive cytopenias. Fatigue, bone pain, headaches, palpitations, and diarrhea quickly relapsed, but there was insufficient improvement in cytopenias and the drug was fully stopped in April 2012. Dasatinib was restarted at 40 mg daily. Two weeks later he reported moderate improvement in many symptoms, but soft-tissue and bone pain continued. By August 2012 he was having so much trouble attending to his work due to his pain that he was considering applying for disability.

Other than neonatal pulmonic valve repair and a number of accidental traumas in childhood, his early medical history was unrevealing, but at age 14 migraine headaches with attendant cognitive dysfunction (“brain fog”) suddenly developed and had persisted, waxing and waning, ever since. The headaches had often been attributed to chronic sinusitis, but the many sinusitis treatments he had tried had been uniformly unhelpful. By age 17 he was sleeping through many classes because classroom lights sometimes triggered headache flares. He suffered four more major accidental traumas at ages 17–18, once requiring resuscitation. He worked for a decade after finishing high school but had been unemployed since age 28 due to chronic right shoulder and back pain arising from a work-related accident. He also noted marked bilateral lower extremity pain had emerged in the months after the accident and was also attributed to this accident, although the only finding on a lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was old right S1 pedicle trauma. His chief complaint was diffusely migratory pain, worst in the legs as a crampy, achy throbbing. Lorazepam and clonazepam tended to help his pain noticeably more than traditional analgesics, but his physicians were reluctant to regularly prescribe benzodiazepines.\\\\nOn review of system he also noted severe gastroesophageal reflux for the prior decade, with frequent non-bloody post-prandial emesis. Esomeprazole helped only modestly. Spicy foods reliably triggered the reflux. Bidirectional endoscopy in 2004 to investigate an unrepeated episode of rectal bleeding was non-diagnostic. Episodic migratory swelling of his bilateral feet, ankles, and hands was also noted. Other problems included many years of intermittent subjective and objective idiopathic fevers, frequent night sweats, occasional chills, episodic diffusely migratory pruritus, eye and throat irritation, intranasal sores, deteriorating dentition, proximal dysphagia, waxing/waning dyspnea, palpitations, panic attacks, presyncope, syncope, diarrhea alternating with constipation, tinnitus, insomnia, poor healing, and diffusely migratory tingling/numbness paresthesias. Extensive evaluations by a variety of specialists had been unrevealing. He denied medication allergies. Past medical history included hypertension. He had not used illegal substances since adolescence.\\\\nExam was notable for fatigue, cane-assisted ambulation, and obvious whole body discomfort with any motion. His skin was diffusely freckled. There were small lipomas scattered about his body which he noted had been progressing in number for several years. There was diffuse mild abdominal tenderness to deep palpation and 4/5 strength in all distal extremities; reflexes were intact. Moderate dermatographism was noted.\\\\nHe appeared diffusely inflamed, but no specific inflammatory ailment had been identified in years of evaluation. Normal bone densitometry was noted. Porphyrin screening was negative. Serum tryptase was normal. In addition to mild relative eosinophilia, elevations in plasma PGD2 and histamine were found. MCAS was diagnosed. Loratadine and famotidine immediately provided major improvements in reflux, dyspnea, fevers, pruritus, and eye and nasal irritation. A one-month trial of celecoxib was moderately helpful for pain, but access to the drug could not be maintained. Serial trials of montelukast and azathioprine provided no additional benefit; trials of doxepin and low-dose imatinib quickly proved intolerable. Lorazepam proved helpful to varying degrees for sleep, malaise, anxiety and panic attacks, fevers, sweats, and palpitations but only mildly helpful for his diffuse pain.\\\\nIn August 2012 HU was begun at 500 mg daily. For his first four-week supply, his pharmacist provided him two-week supplies of formulations from PAR and Barr. In the first two weeks using the Barr formulation, his leg pain was significantly improved, but three days after switching to the PAR formulation, all of his symptoms markedly worsened. Emergency room evaluation was unrevealing. He stopped HU and soon returned to his prior baseline. HU was then tried again with Droxia 200 mg capsules, which immediately reduced his diffuse pain from a persistent 10/10 at baseline to a sustained 6/10.

His parents were often upset with him about his illnesses and often suspected they were factitious. He also had been afflicted since his 20s by chronic diffusely migratory bone and joint and back pains. Chronic headaches and fatigue emerged in his 30s, and by his mid-40s severe gastroesophogeal reflux had emerged that proved refractory to aggressive medical and surgical therapies.

A trial of anti-inflammatories was desired, but aspirin and other traditional NSAIDs were felt to be contraindicated. Celecoxib lessened his fatigue, flushing, bruising, irritability, and cough. Low-dose cromolyn significantly reduced his abdominal discomfort and GI symptoms. Doxepin was unhelpful. Ketotifen further improved his energy. Low-dose lorazepam, too, further helped his malaise and GI symptoms, but diffusely migratory soft-tissue, bone, and joint pain remained a chief complaint.\\\\nIn February 2013 Hydrea-brand HU was begun at 500 mg daily.

The neoplastic cells characteristically exhibited pale, eosinophilic, or clear cytoplasm and rounded nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli. The cells were reported to have shown generally mild atypical features but occasionally large atypical cells were observed in the deeply infiltrated areas (). Extensive perineural invasion was observed. Additionally, two out of 14 and 2 out of 11 right and left obturator lymph nodes were positive for the tumour, respectively.

A 56-year-old man had been followed up (for 10 years—since 1996) for a WHO grade 2 papillary urothelial carcinoma which was localized towards the left lateral wall of the urinary bladder. At a routine follow-up cystoscopic examination, two small tumour foci in the dome of the urinary bladder were found which were resected transurethrally. The microscopic features of the tumour were markedly different from those of his previous tumour by the infiltration of neoplastic cells that were arranged in a diffuse pattern of variably sized nests. There was evidence of invasion of lamina propria and muscular layer. There was no evidence of papillary configuration in the tumour. The tumour cells characteristically exhibited pale to eosinophilic cytoplasm with bland nuclear features. The mitotic activity in the tumour was low, and there was no evidence of perineural invasion. The histological findings were reported to be consistent with those of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma. The option of radical cystoprostatectomy was offered to the patient but he refused to undergo cystoprostatectomy. However, during a follow-up period of 23 months, he developed three recurrences of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma.\\\\nImmunohistochemical studies of the tumour were undertaken and these showed that the percentages of cells that were positive for Ki-67, p53, and p27 were 20%, 40%, and 40% in Case 1 and 15%, 40%, and 50% in Case 2, respectively (). In both Cases 1 and 2, the tumour cells were positive for high-molecular-weight cytokeratin (34βE12) but negative for PSA and low-molecular weight cytokeratin (AE1).\\\\nTerada [] in a report of two cases stated that the nested variant of urothelial carcinoma is characterized by the presence of benign appearing urothelial carcinoma cells in the lamina propria, sparing the surface urothelial involvement, and that the tumour exhibited aggressive clinical course despite having a benign-looking histological appearance. Terada [] reported two cases one in an 80-year-old woman and the second in a 78-year-old man. Terada [] reported that in both cases atypical cells forming nests and tubules were observed in the lamina propria without the involvement of surface urothelium. Additionally, Terada [] reported that one case resembled nephrogenic metaplasia and another resembled proliferated von Brunn's nest or inverted papilloma. Terada [] reported the results of immunohistochemical studies on both tumours as follows.Both cases were positive with P53 and high Ki7 labeling, which suggested that both cases were malignant. One case was characterized by positive cytokeratins, EMA, p53, Ki-67 (labeling = 15%), CD10, CEA, and MUC1. The patients were free of tumour 6 months and at 15 months pursuant to transurethral resection of their bladder tumours.\\\\nCardillo and associates [] stated that in view of the fact that nested variant of urothelial carcinoma is a recently described rare variant of urothelial carcinoma there had not been any prior report of cytologic findings in urine specimens from patients with nested variant of urothelial carcinoma. Cardillo and associates [] reviewed urine specimens from patients with histologically confirmed nested variant of urothelial carcinoma. They evaluated urine specimens that were obtained concurrently with or up to 1 month prior to the patient's surgical procedure. They analysed all the specimens for the presence of cells morphologically similar to the nested variant of urothelial carcinoma cells that were observed in the tissue sections. The cells were observed for the ensuing parameters: the number of neoplastic cells; the cellular arrangement, the cell size and shape, cell borders, as well as cytoplasmic, nuclear, and nucleolar characteristics. They included thirteen urine specimens from 7 patients in the study. Cardillo and associates [] reported that they were able to identify cells that were similar morphologically to cells present in the nests of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma in all cytologic specimens. They iterated that the neoplastic cells for most part were medium sized, round, or polygonal, with abundant, dense, slightly granular basophilic cytoplasm, and well-defined cell borders. The nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio was increased, the nuclear membranes exhibited irregular contours, and the nuclei encompassed coarse chromatin with occasional prominent nucleoli. Cardillo and associates [] made the following concluding iterations.The cytologic features of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma are subtle but distinct. A primary diagnosis of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma is not recommended in view of the subtleness of the findings. However, the presence of cells with the aforedescribed features should warrant a cystoscopic examination with histological confirmation in a patient with a previous history of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma.\\\\nDe Berardinis and associates in 2012 stated that nested variant of urothelial carcinoma is a rare histological entity, with about 80 reported cases []. De Beradinis and associates [] reported the case of 70-year-old man with haematuria who underwent ultrasound scan and cystoscopy which revealed the presence of carcinoma of the urinary bladder. He underwent transurethral resection of the tumour and histology of the resected tumour revealed a high-grade cancer with lamina propria involvement (G3pT1). He had adjuvant intravesical instillation of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin and at follow-up cystoscopy five months later a recurrent tumour was found in the bladder and this tumour was resected. Histological examination revealed a high-grade (G3) nested variant of transitional cell carcinoma with a deep lamina propria involvement (pT1b). Immunohistochemical examination of the tumour revealed high expression of tumour suppressor gene p53 and immunoreactivity for Ki-67. He then underwent radical cystectomy and histological examination of the specimen revealed a mixed urothelial nested variant tumour which was staged pT2a and grade G3 (poorly differentiated) with lymphatic involvement. Twelve months after the first diagnosis of the bladder cancer, he underwent a cycle of intravenous gemcitabine along with cisplatin. The case was reported just after the operation, therefore, there was no follow-up information on the patient's follow-up outcome. However, De Berardinis and associates [] were of the opinion that the aggressive behaviour of this neoplasm would suggest that the correct indication for its treatment should be early radical cystectomy with extended lymph adenectomy in order to avoid the progression of the tumour into the urinary bladder wall or metastatic spread. They also stated that it is important to bear in mind that Ki-67 expression that is low in benign lesions and high in nested variant of bladder cancer can be considered a good method to distinguish between the two entities.\\\\nXiao and associates [] reported 2 cases of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma; the patients in both cases were elderly men, with a predominant involvement of the trigone. Microscopic examination revealed that the tumour cells were arranged in ill-defined nests and had low-grade nuclear features. Both cases had a diffusely infiltrating growth pattern with widespread local disease at cystectomy. Strong immunohistochemical staining for p63 in the neoplastic cells supported the urothelial cell nature of this neoplasm. High p53 and Ki-67 indices of the tumour correlated with the aggressiveness of this subtype of urothelial carcinoma.

A 69-year-old man presented with 2 episodes of visible haematuria. He had computed tomography scan which revealed diffuse thickening of the bladder wall and moderate hydronephrosis. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy or metastatic disease. He did not have urine cytology examination. He underwent cystoscopy and bladder biopsy from the trigone and histological examination of the specimen revealed muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma involving the trigone. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumour revealed immunoreactivity for high-molecular weight cytokeratin 903 and cytokeratins 7 and 20 and negativity for prostatic specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase. He underwent radical cystoprostatectomy. Macroscopic examination revealed that the mucosa of the urinary bladder was oedematous, with focal haemorrhage and necrosis around the trigone. The urinary bladder wall was diffusely thickened and infiltrated by tumour; the trigone of the urinary bladder was most markedly involved, with obstruction of the ureteric orifices (see ). Microscopic examination revealed that with the exception of the surface mucosa, the bladder wall was extensively infiltrated by neoplastic cells, which were arranged in a diffuse pattern of relatively ill-defined and variably sized nests (see Figures and ). There was also evidence of focal urothelial carcinoma in situ and multiple foci of urothelial dysplasia. The cytologic characteristics of the underlying main neoplasm were markedly distinct from those of the surface urothelial mucosal lesions. The neoplastic cells exhibited clear/pale or amophilic/eosinophilic cytoplasm with poorly defined borders and rounded nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli. The chromatin was finely granular and distributed in an even fashion. Rarely, the tumour cells exhibited clear and signet ring characteristics. On the whole, there was no evidence of significant nuclear pleomorphism, and mitosis was rare (see ). Rarely, large atypical cells were observed in the deeply infiltrated area (muscularis propria and fat). Within the infiltrating tumour, a prominent desmoplastic reaction was conspicuous. The main tumour had extended through the vesical wall into the perivesical soft tissue and this had also involved the prostatic urethra and paraurethral tissues. There was evidence of metastatic carcinoma in the perivesical lymph nodes. Additionally, bilateral obturator and iliac lymph nodes did not contain any metastasis.

A 70-year-old man was investigated 3 years earlier when he presented with visible haematuria urinary frequency and occasional straining to void. His repeated urine cytology and intravenous urography were normal and his cystoscopic examination revealed a focal area of localized inflammation on the floor of the urinary bladder lateral to the right ureteric orifice. He was lost to follow-up. However, 3 years later, he presented with recurrent visible haematuria. He had a computed tomography scan which revealed a mild-to-moderate dilation of the distal part of the right ureter and 0.8 cm thickening of the wall of the urinary bladder around the right ureteric orifice. There was no evidence of any significant lymph adenopathy or any other abnormal mass in the pelvis. He underwent transurethral biopsy of the thickened region and histological examination of the specimen revealed infiltration of lamina propria by ill-defined nested neoplastic cells with bland cytologic characteristics (see ). There was also evidence of perineural invasion by the tumour. The immunohistochemical staining characteristics of the tumour include immunoreactivity for high-molecular cytokeratin 903 and cytokeratin 7 and negativity for prostate specific antigen, prostate acid phosphatase, S100, and chromogranin. He subsequently underwent radical cystoprostatectomy elsewhere. The histology report from the institution where he underwent radical cystoprostatectomy stated that the tumour had extended through the lateral wall of the right trigone with vascular invasion and a focus of urothelial carcinoma in situ. The histology report also stated that in addition to the urinary bladder tumour there was focal adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland (Gleason pattern 3 + 3 = 6) which was confined to the left lobe of the prostate gland. The perivesical lymph nodes were negative for metastatic disease. This patient was lost to follow-up two months pursuant to his surgery.\\\\nXiao and associates [] stated that additional immunohistochemical stainings were done on the tumour specimens of the two patients and these showed that the nested neoplastic cells in both cases were strongly immunoreactive for p63 (a homolog of p53 protein) (Figures and ); 40% to 50% and 30% to 40% of tumour cells in Case 1 exhibited strong positivity for p53 and Ki-67, respectively, and no staining difference for either p53 or Ki-67 was present between superficial and deep infiltrating tumour cells. Focally positive stains for both p53 and Ki-67 were exhibited in the biopsy specimen of Case 2. The experience learnt from the biological behaviour of both Cases 1 and 2, especially in Case 1, would be indicative of the aggressive nature of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma.\\\\nKrishnamoorthy and associates [] reported the case of a 46-year-old woman who presented with a two-year history of interrupted stream of urine on voiding. She developed acute urinary retention for which she was catheterized. Further evaluation after her catheterization revealed a large urinary bladder tumour. She did not have any history of haematuria or urinary tract infection. Her urine microscopy revealed 15 red blood cells per high power field. She had ultrasound scan of the abdomen which revealed bilateral mild hydroureteronephrosis up to the vesicoureteric junction. A huge heteroechoic pedunculated mass which measured 10 cm in size, with smooth surface and well-defined margin in the bladder, occupying the entire surface of the urinary bladder. She also had a contrast computed tomography scan of the abdomen which revealed normal liver, pancreas, and adrenals. The computed tomography scan also showed bilateral mild hydroureteronephrosis with a 10 mm simple cyst in the interpolar region of the right kidney. There was a large heterodense mass in the urinary bladder which occupied most of the bladder. There were multiple enlarged lymph nodes involving the parailiac right external iliac, left internal iliac, and left inguinal regions, each measuring from 7 mm to 8 mm in size in transverse diameter. She underwent cystoscopy which revealed a solid 10 cm × 10 cm pedunculated lesion arising from the right lateral and anterior wall of the bladder, which was a rounded, mobile, well-circumscribed tumour with a smooth surface. The mucosa over the mass lesion and the adjoining bladder surface appeared intact. The right ureteric orifice was not seen and the left ureteric orifice looked normal. The tumour was bimanually palpable and mobile. She underwent transurethral resection of the tumour and histological examination of the specimen was reported to have shown nested variant of transitional cell carcinoma with marked atypical epithelial proliferation. Microscopic examination of the tumour revealed that the entire tumour was infiltrated by nests of polygonal cells with oval vesicular to hyperchromatic nuclei and eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm. Cystically dilated cells were also seen. The intervening stroma consisted of spindle cells with fusiform nuclei, compressing the cell nests in some areas, forming broad polypoid projections. There were areas of necrosis with acute inflammatory reaction. The metaplastic stromal cells exhibited no increase in mitotic activity. Krishnamoorthy and associates reported this case at a stage when there was no follow-up information regarding the outcome of the patient. Krishnamoorthy and associates [] stated the following.Nested variant of urothelial carcinoma can easily be confused with a number of benign lesions; it is very important for the pathologist to consider nested variant of urothelial carcinoma in the differential diagnosis of the lesions that show nested type growth pattern in lesions of the urinary bladder. It is equally important for the treating physician to adopt an aggressive approach towards the management of these lesions. The optimal treatment for nested variant of urothelial carcinoma is yet to be determined and this may be because of the rarity of the tumour, very small number of long-term survivors, and the absence of any randomized studies. The aggressive invasive growth and early metastases are the factors that favour radical cystectomy with adjunctive systemic chemotherapy. Nevertheless, a consensus is yet to be arrived at. They had reported their case in view of its rarity, its unusual histology, and its prognostic significance emphasizing the need to distinguish it from the classic transitional cell carcinoma. The aggressive behaviour of these nested variants underlines the importance of distinguishing them from benign proliferative lesions. Cytologic atypia is not a very good parameter because the mild atypia seen in nested variant of transitional cell carcinoma can be very deceptive, especially at low and medium power magnifications. Though the obvious invasion of the muscularis propria excludes the possibility of a benign lesion, the absence of invasion leads the pathologist onto a diagnostic dilemma.\\\\nOoi and associates [] reported a rare presentation of nested variant of transitional cell carcinoma in a 74-year-old man who had bilateral hydronephrosis and acute renal failure. At cystoscopy, both ureters were obstructed with the right ureter narrowed along the entire length. Subsequent histopathologic examination from the ureteral resection revealed nested variant of urothelial carcinoma. Bilateral stents were inserted and the patient survived 12 months with a good partial response to chemotherapy. They stated that at the time of the report of their case in 2006, 76 cases of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma had been reported in the literature and at that time their patient was the first, to their knowledge, to present with bilateral hydronephrosis and tumour extension along one ureter. He had extensive liver and bony metastases and he eventually died 12 months pursuant to the establishment of the diagnosis. Ooi and associates [] stated that even though anecdotal reports of adjunctive chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin are being done, there are no available randomized studies on the effects of adjunctive chemotherapy in these patients with nested variant of urothelial carcinoma, after cystectomy. Furthermore, Holmäng and Johansson [] reported that there was no survival advantage with adjunctive radiotherapy in their series of seven patients with T stage in cystectomy specimens ranging from T1 to T4B.\\\\nHolmäng and Johansson [] stipulated that nested variant of transitional cell carcinoma is aggressive and invasive, with a very well-differentiated histology, which is difficult to understand. Nevertheless, it had been postulated that the unusual histology may be due to the peculiarities of the host response mechanisms to carcinogenic stimulus such that the host is able to channel differentiation but cannot control invasion.\\\\nTatsura and associates [] stated that the nested variant of transitional cell carcinoma has the characteristics of a focus of nests of transitional epithelial cells which infiltrate the lamina propria with apparent involvement of bladder mucosa. They also suggested that immunohistochemical analysis may help in the diagnosis of nested variants of transitional cell carcinoma derived from epithelial cells and that diagnosis and treatment at an early stage should reduce the mortality of patients with nested variant of transitional cell carcinoma.\\\\nMurphy and Deana [] stated that the tumour cells of nested variant of transitional cell carcinoma are organized in nested structures and that many tumour cells are only slightly atypical, but a careful examination revealed that at least some significantly anaplastic cells are identifiable in each case, and the degree of anaplasia has a tendency to parallel the depth of invasion. They additionally stated that the features that identify this lesion as malignant are the tendency for increasing cellular anaplasia in the deeper portions of the lesion, its infiltrative nature, and the presence of muscle invasion. Mai and associates [] stated that despite the presence of mild or minimal cytological atypia in nested variant of transitional cell carcinoma, these neoplasms are occasionally associated with an aggressive clinical course and even death.\\\\nDrew and associates [] reviewed the clinicopathologic features of 16 nested variants of transitional cell carcinoma over a 13-year period. They reported the following.Nested variant of transitional cell carcinoma was characterized by the presence of irregular nests and/or tubules of transitional cells infiltrating the lamina propria without surface involvement. The neoplastic cells tended to have innocuous features but at least a few cells in every case are cytologically anaplastic. There was a marked male predominance. Synchronous or metachronous transitional cell carcinomas of more usual histologic make-up may occur. After a follow-up averaging 16.6 months, only three patients were known to be alive with no evidence of disease.\\\\nDrew and associates [] in 1996 made the ensuing concluding iteration.\\\\nClinicopathologic information from their 16 cases combined with the 8 cases of nested variant of transitional cell carcinoma that were reported before the publication of their paper confirms that nested variant of transitional cell carcinoma is a persistent and aggressive neoplasm that is notable for its innocuous appearance in histologic preparations.\\\\nLiedberg and associates [] reported three cases of the nested variant of urothelial carcinoma that were treated in their institution. They compared their outcome data with those of previously reported cases. They reported that the three patients presented with advanced muscle-invasive nested variant of urothelial carcinoma, of which two had lymph node metastasis at cystoprostatectomy. The histopathology in the latter two cases showed the same picture in the lymph node as in the primary tumour with nests of tumour cells with mild-to-moderate atypia. In all three cases the tumour involved the ureteric orifice or bladder neck. They concluded the following.Nested variant of urothelial carcinoma is a rare but an important histopathologic entity. Nested variant of urothelial carcinoma has a poor prognosis. At an early stage, the tumours might be difficult to differentiate from benign conditions and awareness of this condition is of outermost importance.\\\\nBecause of the rarity of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma most urologists and pathologists would not have encountered a case of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma before and as a result of this there is the possibility that a case of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma may inadvertently be misdiagnosed. It is therefore pertinent to document iterations of Dhall et al. [], which summarize the microscopic features of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma as follows.These tumours are characterized histologically by large numbers of small, closely packed, poorly defined, confluent, and irregular nests of uniform urothelial cells infiltrating the lamina propria, reminiscent of von Brunn nests, and also infiltrating the muscularis propria with retained nested pattern (see Figures and ). These nests exhibit an infiltrative base as described by Volmar et al. []. Small tubules and microcysts may be seen as described by Talbert and Young [] and Young and Oliva []. The overlying urothelium may be normal in appearance. The cells comprising nested variant of urothelial carcinoma exhibit no significant cytologic atypia; they are mildly pleomorphic and show slightly increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and occasionally prominent nucleoli (see ). Even though nested variant of urothelial carcinoma cells appears to be histologically bland, a number of authors [, , ] have observed significant pleomorphism, particularly within regions of muscle invasion. Mitotic figures are not readily seen. Mucin is not identified. The surrounding stroma varies from dense and collagenous to loose and myxoid or even oedematous. Lymphatic invasion may be seen []. In view of their deceptively bland appearance, the tumours are sometimes misdiagnosed as benign lesions, especially in the biopsy material leading in some instances to a significant delay in the establishment of diagnosis as stated by Young and Olive []. In some instances it is very difficult to establish an unequivocal diagnosis of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma in the biopsy material until multiple biopsies are performed. Nested variant of urothelial carcinoma must be differentiated from the benign proliferative lesions of the urothelium, such as von Brunn nests, cystitis cystica, cystitis glandularis, nephrogenic adenoma, paraganglioma, and inverted papilloma (see which illustrates von Brunn nests in comparison with nested variant of urothelial carcinoma showing regularly spaced urothelial nests with a relatively flat base).\\\\nDhall and associates [] stated that the optimal treatment of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma is yet to be determined in view of the rarity of the tumour and in view of absence of randomized studies. They suggested that nested variant of urothelial carcinoma should be approached clinically as a high-grade disease with early cystectomy as an option for pT1 and pT2 tumours []. Dhall and associates [] additionally stated the following that.Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy have not been shown by a number of authors to be significantly beneficial in their reported series [, , ]. Nested variant of urothelial carcinoma should be kept in mind as a histologically unique variant which should not be confused with von Brunn's nest. Any bladder biopsy with tightly packed nests with any degree of architectural or cytological atypia should be evaluated with caution, and the possibility of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma should be raised in such circumstances.\\\\nLinder and associates [] evaluated the oncological outcomes after radical cystectomy in patients with nested variant of urothelial carcinoma and compared survival to that in patients with pure urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Linder and associates [] identified 52 patients with nested variant of urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder who were treated with radical cystectomy between 1980 and 2004. The pathological specimens were rereviewed by a single genitourinary pathologist. The patients were matched 1 : 2 by age, gender, ECOG (Eastern COOperative Oncology Group) performance status, pathological tumour stage, and nodal status to patients with pure urothelial carcinoma. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log rank test. Linder and associates [] reported that the patients with nested variant of urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder had a median age of 69.5 years (IQR 62, 74) and a median postoperative follow-up of 10.8 years (IQR 9.3, 11.2). They also reported that nested variant cancer was associated with a high rate of adverse pathological features since 36 patients (69%) had pT3-pT4 disease and 10 (19%) had nodal invasion. Eight patients (15%) with nested variant cancer received preoperative chemotherapy. When the patients with the nested variant were matched to a cohort with pure urothelial carcinoma, no significant differences were noted in 10-year local recurrence-free survival (83% versus 80%, P = 0.46) or 10-year cancer specific survival (41% versus 46%, P = 0.75). Linder and associates [] concluded that the nested variant of urothelial carcinoma is associated with a high rate of locally advanced disease at radical cystectomy. However, when stage matched to patients with pure urothelial carcinoma, patients with the nested variant did not have an increased rate of recurrence or adverse survival. Linder and associates [] iterated that further studies are required to validate these findings and guide the optimal multimodal treatment approach to these patients.\\\\nTripodi et al. [] reported the case of a 49-year-old woman affected by hepatitis C virus who presented with fever, discomfort, urgency, and hypertension. She had a computed tomography scan which showed a sclerosing inflammatory process that involved the connective and adipose tissue of the renal sinus. In absence of renal or pelvic masses felt that an underlying malignancy was excluded and renal abscess or tuberculosis was suspected. Accordingly, nephrectomy and proximal ureterectomy was performed. Tripodi et al. [] reported the following.Grossly, the calices, renal pelvis, and pelviureteric junction appeared modestly dilated with whitish, thickened, and uneven mucosa. Microscopic examination revealed that the subepithelial connective tissue, the fibromuscular layer, and the renal sinus fat were diffusely infiltrated by small nests of medium to large urothelial cells which were immunohistochemically stained positively with p63 and they had abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and slightly atypical nuclei.\\\\nTripodi et al. [] stated the following.On the basis of morphologic and immunohistochemical features, a diagnosis of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma was made. After surgery, the patient recovered from hypertension. Pelvic and upper urothelial tract nested variant of urothelial carcinoma was uncommon, and to the best of their knowledge, their case was the second case of nested variant of urothelial carcinoma with renal pelvis involvement.\\\\nCerda et al. [] submitted an abstract for a poster presentation at the 25th European Congress of Pathology in Lisbon, Portugal (August 31st, to September 4th, 2013).

Six weeks prior to presentation, she experienced a flu-like illness with headache, fevers, myalgias, and athralgias. On examination, there was a non-blanching petechial rash over the dorsum of the left foot with associated edema and warmth, but no erythema. Peripheral pulses were normally palpable with normal capillary refill. Neurological exam of the foot was normal except for 4/5 power on plantar flexion due to pain. Ultrasound of the leg showed a thrombus in the lateral tarsal artery raising a possibility of an embolus.\\\\nHer past medical history was remarkable for mild childhood asthma that was associated with viral infections and exercise; and allergic rhinitis. She had no prior hospitalizations. Chest X-ray was unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed T-wave inversion in most precordial leads (V2–V6) and some inferior leads (III and aVF) (Fig. ).\\\\nRoutine blood work was unremarkable except for eosinophilia which was attributable to asthma. Inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 41 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) 22 mg/l were mildly elevated. Troponin was negative. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed to evaluate for a possible cardiac embolic source was unremarkable except for mildly increased left ventricular (LV) apical wall thickness (Additional file : Movie S1). Given the abnormal ECG and increased LV apical wall thickness, CMR was requested to assess for possible apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).\\\\n3 T CMR (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen Germany) showed normal biventricular size and systolic function with only minimal increase in the LV apical wall thickness (Additional file : Movie S2, Additional file : Movie S3, Additional file : Movie S4).\\\\nThe LV mass index was 64 g/m2, the LV end diastolic volume index was 73 ml/m2, with a low normal LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of 57%. The right ventricular (RV) size and systolic function were normal with an RV end diastolic volume index of 74 ml/m2 and RV ejection fraction (RVEF) of 51%. LV tissue characterization revealed subtle sub-endocardial abnormalities. T2-weighted (T2w) imaging showed somewhat diffuse sub endomyocardial edema in mid to distal LV segments (Fig. ). Rest perfusion sequences in short axis and apical 4-chamber view showed mid to apical sub-endocardial hypo-perfusion (Additional file : Movie S5, Additional file : Movie S6).\\\\nLate gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging using T1-weighted (T1w) imaging in short axis showed subendocardial enhancement in the mid to distal LV segments (Fig. ). These findings correlated with phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) LGE imaging in 3- and 4-chamber views (Fig. ) also showing subtle subendocardial enhancement in the mid- and distal-LV segments.\\\\nMulti-parametric CMR: Pre- and post- contrast T1 mapping was performed a using modified Look-Locker inversion (MOLLI) sequence (Myomaps, Siemens Healthineers). Region of interest involving apical septum had an elevated T1 of 1385 ms (normal ~ 1150–1300 ms) as well as extracellular volume (ECV) of 39% (normal ~ 20–30%). In the remote myocardium (uninvolved basal inferoseptum) native T1 was in the normal range (1279 ms) and ECV was within normal limits (25%) (Fig. ). Color maps confirmed subendocardial elevation in pre-contrast T1 and ECV in mid to apical LV segments (Fig. ).\\\\nThe patient was subsequently investigated for a systemic disease such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangitis (EGPA). Chest computed tomography (CT) identified non-specific sub-pleural inflammatory changes (Fig. ). CT guided needle biopsy of this lesion demonstrated eosinophilic infiltrates consistent with acute eosinophilic pneumonia with some vascular changes. The patient was subsequently treated with induction course of intravenous methyl prednisone followed by rituximab with good symptomatic and biochemical response to therapy (follow up ESR 4 mm/h, CRP of < 2 mg/l resolution of eosinophilia).\\\\nRepeat CMR 6 months after treatment showed almost complete resolution of previously noted subendocardial abnormalities (Additional file : Movie S7, Additional file : Movie S8 and Fig. ). Post treatment apical septum native T1 (1288 ms) and ECV (30%) returned to normal range.\\\\nIn the context of the patient’s history, the findings on CMR were suspicious for endo-myocarditis related to early stage EGPA. CT chest revealed clinically silent pulmonary infiltrates with CT-guided biopsy of these lungs infiltrates confirming eosinophilic pneumonia, and therefore avoiding cardiac biopsy. The final diagnosis was EGPA causing lateral tarsal artery thrombosis, with respiratory involvement, sinusitis and asymptomatic cardiac involvement. The patient improved with immune suppression. Repeat CMR performed 6 months post treatment revealed significant interval resolution of abnormal CMR findings.\\\\nEGPA, previously known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, is a multisystem disorder characterized by chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, and prominent peripheral blood eosinophilia (≥ 1500 cells/microL and/or > 10% eosinophils on differential leukocyte count). The etiology of EGPA remains unknown. Asthma is the cardinal feature (occurring in more than 95% of patients) and usually precedes the vasculitic phase by approximately 8 to 10 years.\\\\nThe American College of Rheumatology criteria for the classification of EGPA requires at least four of the following six criteria: asthma, eosinophilia > 10%, mononeuritis or polyneuritis, non-fixed pulmonary infiltrates, paranasal sinus abnormality and extravascular eosinophils []. It is a rare condition with an estimated annual incidence of 1.0 to 4.2 people per million [].\\\\nCardiac involvement is one of the more serious manifestations of EGPA, accounting for approximately half of attributable mortality. It should be suspected in the presence of refractory dyspnea, pericarditis related symptom, clinical evidence of heart failure (HF), or cardiac rhythm abnormalities, but can also be asymptomatic. Endomyocarditis may represent the most severe manifestation with eventually fatal outcome. A structured clinical assessment incorporating cardiac imaging with TTE and CMR can identify impaired cardiac function and endomyocardial abnormalities []. CMR is superior to TTE revealing cardiac abnormalities in 62% of Churg-Strauss patients compared to 50% by TTE []. Furthermore in this study, the absence of cardiac symptoms or ECG abnormalities did not exclude cardiac involvement, because CMR abnormalities could still be detected in 38% of these patients.\\\\nCMR is a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of HCM, as it can differentiate HCM from other mimicking conditions because of its superior spatial resolution and its ability to tissue characterize. Tissue characterization by CMR can differentiate eosinophilic endomyocarditis from apical HCM. Unlike apical HCM which usually has midmyocardial apical LGE, eosinophilic endomyocarditis typically has diffuse subendocardial enhancement, often associated with thrombus []. Furthermore this case highlights that CMR is more sensitive than TTE in detecting cardiac involvement in EGPA and occasionally CMR can provide important clues and contribute towards the EPGA diagnostic criteria. Finally, early diagnosis by CMR in this case led to early immunosuppressive treatment and potentially prevented catastrophic complications.\\\\nThe CMR of Case 1 (Additional file CMR Link, ).', 'patient_id': '8015162-1', 'age': \"[[19.0, 'year']]\", 'gender': 'F', 'sentences': ['19-year-old woman', 'Painful atraumatic left ankle swelling', 'Painful plantar-flexion', 'Petechial rash on the left foot', 'Flu-like illness with headache, fevers, myalgias, and athralgias', 'Mild childhood asthma', 'Allergic rhinitis', 'Non-blanching petechial rash', 'Edema and warmth on the left foot', 'Normal capillary refill', '4/5 power on plantar flexion', 'Thrombus in the lateral tarsal artery', 'Eosinophilia', 'Inflammatory markers elevated', 'T-wave inversion on ECG', 'Mildly increased left ventricular apical wall thickness', 'Normal biventricular size and systolic function', 'Subtle sub-endocardial abnormalities', 'Sub-endomyocardial edema', 'Mid to apical sub-endocardial hypo-perfusion', 'Subendocardial enhancement', 'Elevated T1 and ECV in the apical septum', 'Acute eosinophilic pneumonia', 'Eosinophilic infiltrates', 'Vascular changes', 'Non-specific sub-pleural inflammatory changes', 'Chest computed tomography', 'Induction course of intravenous methyl prednisone', 'Rituximab', 'Good symptomatic and biochemical response to therapy']}\n","Finished report 3014\n","********************\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p'].

She was treated with adriamycin (cumulative dose of 400 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab (Herceptin®, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA). She also received ADO–trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla®, Genentech) for a history of metastatic breast cancer previously receiving treatment with trastuzumab. During her chemotherapy regimen, a TTE revealed reduced LV systolic function (LVEF 48%). She was subsequently evaluated for the possibility of chemotherapy induced cardiomyopathy. Due to her decreased LVEF, continuous measurements of LVEF accompanied the trastuzumab treatment. Prior to chemotherapy, she had a past medical history of hypertension, left bundle branch block (LBBB) and hyperlipidemia. Medications included atorvastatin and carvedilol (12-lead ECG, Fig. ). At this time the chemotherapy included carboplatin, gemcitabine, and trastuzumab. Given the decreased LVEF and existence of cardiovascular comorbidities, there was an immediate need to establish a diagnosis of cardiotoxicity.\\\\nA CMR with only myocardial strain analysis-based research investigation was carried out to further establish a diagnosis of cardiotoxicity. Traditional CMR sequences, including cine balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP), T1/T2 mapping, and LGE were not performed. Comprehensive analysis of her LV contractile parameters included CMR-based computations of 3D myocardial strains and torsion to predict the extent of dysfunction in a manner more quantitatively detailed than conventional LVEF measurements. CMR data were obtained with the Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) sequence (Additional file : Movie S9) and 3D strains and torsion analysis conducted with an automated (patented) research algorithm consisting of multi-threshold image quantization for LV boundary detection, displacement analysis via phase unwrapping and strain analysis using a rapid meshfree methodology [–]. This research algorithm, which has been validated over several past studies, was used as a single-scan tool that provided comprehensive and automated analysis of LV chamber quantifications and 3D strain analysis. In this case the analysis required less than six minutes of processing time for 15 short axis slices [–]. Immediate signs of cardiac dysfunction can be observed from Fig. a where a biased and unusual septal twitch becomes obvious during systole compared to a normal systolic contraction in a healthy subject (Fig. b). The peak systolic longitudinal strain was significantly lower than healthier ranges found in our normal subjects’ database, which were − 9% (vs − 14 ± 4%), − 13% (vs − 19 ± 3%), − 14% (vs − 22 ± 4%) for the basal, mid-ventricular and apical LV regions, respectively. Similarly, peak systolic torsions were significantly different from the ranges found in the healthy subjects, which were 4.1 (vs 8.8 ± 1.7) radians for the mid-ventricular and 5.5 (vs 10.6 ± 1.6) for the apical LV regions (both with respect to the basal region). The lowered peak systolic torsions in comparison to a healthy subject can be seen in Fig. .\\\\nCardiotoxicity is a likely diagnosis given the patient’s age, chemotherapy exposure, and existence of cardiac comorbidities. Furthermore, follow up TTE now showed an LVEF < 25%. Abnormal CMR-based contractile function and strain analysis are strong indicators of cardiotoxicity that were not revealed by the earlier LVEF measurements. It also indicates the possibilities of consistent, long-term assessments of myocardial strain parameters supplementing routine cardiac examinations to support treatment options.\\\\nIn regards to whether the findings of abnormal strain are related to the LBBB, a strong argument can be made that this is a combined deteriorating effect of cardiotoxicity and LBBB, where cardiotoxicity intensifies co-existing cardiac dysfunctions as shown in previous studies [, ]. The combined effect of two different dysfunctions is evident in this patient from the biased displacements (Fig. ) found in the entire short axis cross section which is not exclusive to her septum. The existence of the cardiotoxicity is further supported by the reductions seen in global longitudinal strain (GLS) and torsion in the entire LV, which are parameters shown in previous studies as being effective in detecting cardiotoxicity [, ]. Importantly, the follow-up TTE showed an LVEF < 25%, a marked deterioration between studies. This conforms to guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT) based diagnosis of cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients treated with anthracyclines and trastuzumab. Other CMR parameters of cardiotoxicity, T1/T2 contrast mapping showing the diffuse myocardial fibrosis (DMF) that occur with cardiotoxicity, could have mirrored the strain-based mechanisms of finding the underlying dysfunction []. However, the uncertainty remains that her LV dysfunction could entirely be an effect of LBBB. The newly patented algorithm for DENSE-based strain analysis used in this case is available via an application with user interface where automated analysis typically takes five minutes in a patient, validated against the gold standard of tissue tagging [, , ]. Hence, the DENSE strains are expected to be similar to those measured clinically with TTE and harmonic phase (HARP), and HARP protocols are commonly validated in comparison to tissue tagging. Echocardiogram strain measurements as recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) for post-chemotherapy assessments (including associated dose adjustment) would have added more robustness to this case []. DENSE is best suited for imaging systolic function in cardiotoxicity as it is fast with high resolution unlike CMR tissue tagging. DENSE does not suffer from excessive artifacts, noise, or decreased resolution due to the asymmetrically sampled spectral peak also found in HARP. The repeatability and reproducibility of DENSE data is independent of operator accuracy, a common challenge in echocardiographic strain []. Ultimately, many breast cancer patients who have been cured via chemotherapy may suffer from progressive LV dysfunction due to chemotherapy induced cardiotoxicity and symptomatic HF [–, ]. These studies repeatedly emphasize that despite recent advancements in HF treatment, a majority of patients with cardiotoxicity-induced cardiac dysfunction show no improvement in LV systolic function, and that the benefits of detecting cardiotoxicity early in its manifestation (not always apparent from small declines in LVEF) cannot be ignored.\\\\nA study by Siedman et al. demonstrated that the abnormal septal motion in systole undermined treatment efficacy when patients were administered a combined dose of chemotherapy agents including anthracyclines, trastuzumab and cyclophosphamides []. In this context, studies also show that myocardial dysfunction measured with global and regional computations of 3D strain (and torsion) are more sensitive toward early detection of cardiotoxicity prior to LVEF deterioration. Additionally, the ability to detect cardiotoxicity more sensitively via analysis of strain parameters (longitudinal strain and torsion) was shown by two previous studies [, ]. Hence, detecting cardiotoxicity related dysfunction via CMR DENSE-based strain analysis is a viable methodology that should be practiced more in mainstream clinical diagnosis of chemotherapy induced cardiomyopathy toward further improving the quality of surveillance required in this patient population.\\\\nThe CMR of Case 2 (Additional file CMR Link, ).', 'patient_id': '8015162-2', 'age': \"[[54.0, 'year']]\", 'gender': 'F', 'sentences': ['54-year-old woman', 'Left-sided breast cancer', 'Adriamycin', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Trastuzumab', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Reduced LV systolic function', 'Hypertension', 'Left bundle branch block', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Atorvastatin', 'Carvedilol', 'Carboplatin', 'Gemcitabine', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular comorbidities', 'LVEF < 25%', 'Cardiotoxicity diagnosis', 'Cardiotoxicity treatment', 'Cardiotoxicity monitoring', 'Cardiotoxicity detection', 'Cardiotoxicity assessment', 'Cardiotoxicity evaluation', 'Cardiotoxicity management', 'Cardiotoxicity follow-up', 'Cardiotoxicity treatment options']}\n","Finished report 3015\n","********************\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p'].

Initial evaluation with abdomen/pelvis CT demonstrated wedge shaped areas of low attenuation in her spleen and right kidney consistent with infarction. She also had a dynamic ileus secondary to bowel infarction along with findings suggestive of an embolus in her superior mesenteric artery (SMA). CT also revealed a possible 2 × 4.1 cm “mass” within the LV. Empiric anticoagulation with heparin was started and she underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection, SMA embolic material removal and patch angioplasty of the SMA.\\\\nTTE on the day after admission showed an LVEF of 65% without regional dysfunction. It also confirmed an LV “mass” near the outflow tract which measured 3.2 × 2.3 cm (Fig. ). The mass was hypovascular and pedunculated with an attachment to the basal anteroseptal wall. Second look surgery on the following day showed that the areas of questionable viability from her first surgery were frankly ischemic, as a result of which she underwent ileostomy and jejunostomy, leaving only 20 cm of viable terminal ileum and the entire colon. She underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) 2 days later, which corroborated the TTE findings, revealing an LV “mass” (Fig. ).\\\\nInitial interpretation of the “mass” favored a myxoma but a thrombus was also suspected. A CMR performed a week after her admission showed findings consistent with a thrombus that had embolized from the LV into the aortic arch. On the following day a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple cerebral infarctions in her internal carotid artery territory (Fig. ). Pathology results confirmed that the SMA embolic material was indeed thrombus. Due to difficulty managing her heparin, anticoagulation was changed to enoxaparin. The patient was found to suffer from left middle cerebral and posterior cerebral artery strokes when she had symptoms of right hemiparesis, dysarthria and word finding difficulty. Thrombolysis or thrombectomy were not undertaken as the patient was anticoagulated and had poor carotid access. She had residual right side hemianopsia with no other residual deficits.\\\\nHer anticoagulation was then changed to fondaparinux, to be continued indefinitely. She was ultimately discharged to inpatient rehabilitation with plans to be evaluated later for intestinal transplant due to short gut syndrome. After rehabilitation, she was able to walk but used a wheelchair and walker for ambulating a longer distance.\\\\nThe CMR revealed a LVEF of 60% with normal dimensions and regional systolic function without any LV mass (Additional file : Movie S10, Additional file : Movie S11, Additional file : Movie S12, Additional file : Movie S13).\\\\nThe patient had a bovine aortic arch anatomy and was found to have a 2.8 × 1.9 cm occlusive thrombus in the proximal aortic arch extending into the proximal innominate artery. The thrombus had low signal intensity on bSSFP imaging, short T1 and T2 consistent with methemoglobin, and was hypointense on LGE (Additional file : Movie S14, Additional file : Movie S15, Additional file : Movie S16, Additional file : Movie S17, Additional file : Movie S18, Additional file : Movie S19).\\\\nWe report a case of an LV thrombus that embolized in its entirety to the aortic arch, innominate artery and caused multi focal infarcts in the SMA and internal carotid artery distributions. Our report emphasizes the use of comprehensive CMR imaging in the assessment and differentiation of cardiac masses. In our patient, even though the “mass” had embolized by the time the CMR was performed, its tissue characterization abilities were critical in identifying that it was a thrombus. The mass had a high signal and a short T1 consistent with methemoglobin. Overall, due to a larger field of view, greater spatial resolution, lack of attenuation, and ability to image in any plane along with its superior tissue characterization properties, CMR is the gold standard for assessment of cardiac masses [].\\\\nThere have been several case reports of thrombus mimicking cardiac tumors. LV thrombus formation is a well-known complication of a myocardial infarction, LV aneurysm, cardiomyopathy or a hypercoagulable state. It is uncommon for a thrombus to form in a normal LV in the absence of a wall motion abnormality. Initial interpretation of the “mass” favored myxoma due to the absence of these factors. The specific etiology for formation of thrombus is unclear as her imaging and hypercoagulable work up did not point to a specific cause. Notably, she was on medroxyprogesterone injections but her hypercoagulable work up was negative for anticardiolipin antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, lipoprotein A, beta 2 glycoprotein, and JAK (Janus Kinsae) 2 mutation.\\\\nImaging plays a critical role in establishing a diagnosis and planning management. TTE, TEE, and CMR have all been used to detect the presence of cardiac tumors and thrombi []. CMR has a superior sensitivity and specificity of 88 ± 9% and 99 ± 2% in comparison to echocardiography and has enhanced ability to identify thrombi and differentiate from other cardiac masses because of superior tissue characterization []. T1 weighted CMR imaging has been successful in identifying acute/subacute thrombi due to the short T1 effect of methemoglobin [, ]. On CMR, recent thrombi have a shorter T1 than old thrombi due to the presence of methemoglobin and hence a brighter signal on T1 weighted images [].\\\\nIt is important to establish whether the mass is a tumor, thrombus or vegetation due to their different complications and therapeutic implications. Treatment of thrombi includes adequate anticoagulation. In our patient, no intervention was performed as the thrombus had already embolized into the aortic arch.\\\\nThe CMR of Case 3 (Additional file CMR Link, ).', 'patient_id': '8015162-3', 'age': \"[[46.0, 'year']]\", 'gender': 'F', 'sentences': ['46 year old woman', 'Generalized abdominal pain', 'Spleen infarction', 'Right kidney infarction', 'Bowel infarction', 'Embolus in superior mesenteric artery (SMA)', 'Possible 2 × 4.1 cm mass in left ventricle (LV)', 'Left ventricle (LV) mass', 'Hypovascular and pedunculated LV mass', '20 cm of viable terminal ileum', 'Entire colon', 'Left middle cerebral and posterior cerebral artery strokes', 'Left hemiparesis', 'Right hemianopsia', 'Short gut syndrome', 'Bovine aortic arch anatomy', '2.8 × 1.9 cm occlusive thrombus in the proximal aortic arch', 'Proximal innominate artery thrombus', 'Methemoglobin', 'Low signal intensity on bSSFP imaging', 'Short T1 and T2 consistent with methemoglobin', 'Hypointense on LGE']}\n","Finished report 3016\n","********************\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p'].

The patient did not receive chemotherapy. The patient presented with complaints of shortness of breath and hemoptysis. TTE revealed a left atrial (LA) mass with no right heart involvement detected. As renal cell carcinomas most commonly involve the heart by extension through the inferior vena cava (IVC) and right-side chambers, a LA thrombus was initially suspected in this case. The patient was referred for CMR to verify the diagnosis prior to starting anticoagulants.\\\\nCMR was performed using at 1.5 T (Magnetom Aera, Siemens Healthineers). Given the patient’s shortness of breath, real time axial cine and black blood axial images were acquired through the chest and upper abdomen. These images revealed widespread metastatic masses involving the liver, mediastinum and lungs with extension through the pulmonary veins (Additional file : Movie S20). The mediastinal masses appeared continuous with the LA mass, raising the possibility of extension of the malignant tumor to the LA.\\\\nFor mass characterization, ECG gated axial T2, axial T2 with fat suppression, axial T1, and first pass contrast imaging after injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent (Magnevist, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany, 0.2 mmol/kg), 1, 5 and 10 min after contrast injection images were acquired. ECG gated delayed post contrast images were acquired with high inversion time (700 ms) to assess for possible thrombus.\\\\nA single, well defined, infiltrative mass was seen in the LA measuring 5.7 × 5.3 × 3.6 cm (Additional file : Movie S21, Additional file : Movie S22, Additional file : Movie S23). The LA mass compromised mitral valve inflow, protruding into the LV. No other cardiac chamber or valvular involvement was detected. The mass extended into the LA through infiltration of the left sided pulmonary veins, a part of multiple mediastinal and bilateral lung metastases (Fig. ).\\\\nBiventricular size and regional/global systolic function were normal. Focal pericardial infiltration over the LV and along the posterior and inferior pericardial surfaces was noted (Fig. ). Multiple pleural masses were also seen. No pericardial or pleural effusions were present. The mass demonstrated hyperintense T1 and T2 signal relative to the myocardium (Figs. , ).\\\\nMild enhancement was noted during first pass perfusion (Additional file : Movie S24), with mild enhancement also seen in early post contrast images. This could be secondary to contrast moving over the surface of the mass as opposed to true mass perfusion. Decreased LGE was detected (Fig. ). There was a possible hemorrhagic component. No calcifications, central breakdown, or fatty components to the mass were detected.\\\\nRegarding the great vessels, the thoracic aorta was spared from metastatic involvement, with the arch and descending thoracic aorta passing tangential to the mediastinal masses with no definite intravascular extension or narrowing of the arch detected. The left pulmonary artery is infiltrated with attenuation of its diameter. No definite intravascular involvement was detected in the main or right pulmonary arteries (Additional file : Movie S25).\\\\nThere is a very large liver mass measuring 14 × 11 cm seen infiltrating the right sided hepatic veins and compressing the hepatic portion of IVC (Fig. ). There is absent connections between the extra-thoracic and hepatic vein malignant tissue and the intra-cardiac tumor. While the hepatic portion of the IVC was spared, wall infiltration with narrowing was seen just before entrance into the right atrium (RA).\\\\nMultiple metastases were seen in the lungs bilaterally, with largest lesion seen in the left lower lung lobe measuring 10 × 7.5 cm. Multiple mediastinal and para-hilar lymph nodes were seen, the largest of which was in the subcarinal group measuring 4.7 cm.\\\\nWhile aggressive chemotherapy and thrombolytics were initially planned, the plan was altered due to the CMR findings. Based on the CMR findings, the masses visualized were felt to most likely be consistent with widespread metastatic disease. Ultimately, palliative chemotherapy was offered and the patient unfortunately died. Pathology assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal masses was not performed.\\\\nThis case highlights the importance of an organized approach regarding clinical decision making and diagnostic imaging studies performed, as management approaches can sometimes be changed based on confirmatory testing.\\\\nCMR is an invaluable noninvasive imaging modality to assess cardiac masses.

Fetal echocardiogram at 26-weeks’ gestation revealed a single, large, homogenous, hyperechoic cardiac mass occupying bi-atrial cavities with unobstructed intra-cardiac flows (Additional file : Movie S26, Additional file : Movie S27). There was normal biventricular systolic function and no pericardial effusion. Serial fetal echocardiograms showed the size of the mass increasing in proportion to the rest of the cardiac size.\\\\nPostnatally, the infant was clinically well. TTE confirmed a large mass measuring 11 × 13 mm, arising from the Eustachian valve and predominantly occupying the RA cavity, with unobstructed intra-cardiac flows (Additional file : Movie S28, Additional file : Movie S29, Additional file : Movie S30, Additional file : Movie S31, Additional file : Movie S32). There was a patent foramen ovale with left to right shunt.\\\\nLow dose aspirin was started for thromboprophylaxis. Tuberous sclerosis work-up including a brain MRI, renal ultrasound and genetic testing were negative. Patient was discharged home with plan for outpatient CMR. The infant continued to thrive well with no complications related to the mass.\\\\nCMR was performed to characterize the tumor. In view of patient age, the procedure was performed under general anesthesia with breath-holding. On cine bSSFP sequences, there was an irregular dumbbell-shaped mass attached to the Eustachian valve on the right side of the interatrial septum measuring 5 × 11 cm (axial plane) and 8 × 12 mm (sagittal plane) (Additional file : Movie S31). There was no obstruction to intracardiac flows.\\\\nThe mass was isointense on T1w sequences with and without fat saturation, suggesting a non-fatty mass. On T2w sequence with fat suppression the mass was non-homogenously hyperintense (Fig. ). There was early uptake of contrast to the center of the mass on first pass perfusion suggesting a vascular tumor (Additional file : Movie S32). The mass was not visualized on early gadolinium sequences (TI 600 ms) while there was intense enhancement on LGE imaging (Fig. ).\\\\nIn view of the patient’s age, tumor location, and clinical presentation, a benign hemangioma was considered the most likely diagnosis based upon the current CMR knowledge (see Table ) []. With a mass that was not growing in size and no clinical complications in the form of arrhythmia, heart failure or obstruction, there was no indication to obtain a tissue diagnosis. The infant was conservatively managed with low dose aspirin and was closely monitored with serial TTEs that revealed decreasing tumor size.\\\\nCMR sequences currently available do not allow distinction among benign vascular tumors (e.g., hemangioma), malignant vascular tumors (e.g., angiosarcoma), vascular malformations, and tumors with ample vascular supply (e.g., paraganglioma). Primary vascular cardiac tumors such as hemangiomas are extremely rare (< 10% of all primary cardiac tumors in children). Congenital cardiac hemangiomas can present as fetal arrhythmia, hydrops fetalis and intrauterine fetal demise. Neonates can be asymptomatic, but can also present with cardiac tamponade, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure or sudden death [].\\\\nAsymptomatic children are best managed conservatively by closely monitoring for development of complications. The role of medical therapy is limited; there is no proven role for beta blockers, while steroids have mixed results. Surgery is only offered for rapidly growing or symptomatic tumors and, steroid therapy is reserved for patients with unresectable tumors []. The present case highlights the role of CMR in non-invasive diagnosis of vascular cardiac tumors by a combination of imaging sequences for tissue characterization [].\\\\nThe CMR of Case 5 (Additional file CMR Link, ).', 'patient_id': '8015162-5', 'age': \"[[30.0, 'year']]\", 'gender': 'F', 'sentences': ['30 year old gravida 2 para 1 female', 'fetal intracardiac mass', 'single, large, homogenous, hyperechoic cardiac mass', 'bi-atrial cavities', 'normal biventricular systolic function', 'Eustachian valve', 'right side of the interatrial septum', 'dumbbell-shaped mass', 'isointense on T1w sequences', 'non-homogenously hyperintense on T2w sequence', 'vascular tumor', 'benign hemangioma', 'infant', 'low dose aspirin', 'TTE', 'cardiac tamponade', 'arrhythmias', 'congestive heart failure', 'sudden death']}\n","Finished report 3018\n","********************\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p'].

Upon emergency medical services (EMS) arrival, he was noted to be in monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (Fig. ) that needed immediate synchronized cardioversion with subsequent resolution of his symptoms. Upon arrival to the emergency room, the patient was hemodynamically stable with benign cardiovascular examination. Resting ECG (Fig. ) showed sinus tachycardia with T wave inversions over the lateral leads.\\\\nLab analysis revealed sub-therapeutic prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (INR). Initial work up with coronary angiography revealed trivial coronary artery disease and possible congenital coronary anomaly. TTE on the day after admission demonstrated a LV apical aneurysm with mural thrombus formation. Chest X-ray showed a calcified nodule at the cardiac apex, which correlates to the calcified intramural thrombus. Subsequently, coronary CT angiography (Fig. ) revealed a potentially malignant, anomalous right coronary artery (RCA) with left coronary cusp origin just anterior to the origin of the left main coronary artery. This anomalous vessel coursed transmurally between the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery; thus, there is a significant risk for vessel impingement both in the transmural course during systole and between the aorta and the pulmonary artery.\\\\nTTE with an ultrasound enhancing agent showed mid-LV hypertrophy and an apical LV aneurysm with an apical mass suspicious for a thrombus.\\\\nSubsequent CMR showed mid LV hypertrophy consistent with HCM and LV apical aneurysm with intramural thrombus. LGE imaging revealed full thickness scarring in the LV apex. Ultimately, an automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was placed, and the patient was sent home with oral anticoagulation and antiarrhythmic therapy. Patient was counseled and recommended to undergo genetic testing for HCM.\\\\nThe CMR bSSFP cine images revealed an LVEF of 60% with an apical LV aneurysm measuring 3.9 × 3.2 cm, with moderate hypertrophy of the mid-ventricular myocardium measuring 1.6 cm in maximal thickness consistent with HCM. A 1.2 × 1.0 cm lesion was noted within the apical aneurysm, consistent with intramural thrombus (Additional file : Movie S33, Additional file : Movie S34, Fig. ). Also, LGE images revealed near full thickness scarring of the apical LV segments (Fig. ).\\\\nWe report a case of malignant VT with three plausible causes: anomalous RCA with a potentially malignant course, LV apical scarring with aneurysm formation and HCM. However, the apical scar is the most likely cause of the VT based on the VT tracing (Fig. ). This case emphasizes the role and importance of CMR in evaluation of new-onset VT as it helped determine the most probable source of this life-threatening arrhythmia and saved the patient from undergoing aggressive surgical intervention like: excision and re-implantation of RCA into the appropriate sinus of Valsalva, coronary artery bypass grafting or trans-aortic unroofing of the RCA since such surgical procedures have considerable morbidity and mortality. Hence, it was reasonable to only proceed to ICD implantation in addition to pharmacologic therapy.\\\\nVT is a life-threatening arrhythmia, and along with ventricular fibrillation, is the most common cause of outpatient sudden cardiac death. Ventricular arrhythmia mostly occurs in setting of structural heart diseases like post-myocardial infarction (most frequently), coronary artery anomalies, dilated cardiomyopathy, HCM, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, and infiltrative diseases like sarcoidosis in addition to non-structural heart diseases like in long QT syndromes. Hence, in patients with new-onset VT, it is vital to pinpoint the source of the aberrant rhythm to prevent the recurrence of potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. As was true in this case, multi-modality imaging plays a major role in evaluation and management of this arrhythmia.\\\\nThe following will be a discussion of the three potential origins:Anomalous RCA While most of coronary artery anomalies are not associated with myocardial ischemia and clinical events, some anomalies can potentially result in myocardial ischemia depending on the location and course of the anomaly; thus, they can manifest with angina pectoris, syncope, myocardial infarction and VT; however, coronary anomalies are considered an under-diagnosed cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes []. Anomalies of RCA include ectopic origin from the right sinus of Valsalva, posterior sinus of Valsalva and left sinus of Valsalva. Our patient has ectopic RCA originating from left sinus of Valsalva which has an incidence rate of 0.03% to 0.92% on coronary angiograms []. In our patient, the long intramural course of the anomalous RCA in addition to its inter-arterial course between the aorta and pulmonary artery can potentially result in compression especially during exercise and decreased blood flow to myocardium potentiating ischemic ventricular arrhythmia. Coronary anomalies can be seen on echocardiography, angiography, coronary CT and CMR with coronary CT being the clinical standard due to its widespread availability, ease of use, high spatial resolution and very short acquisition time []. Left ventricular apical scar Ventricular scar or fibrosis most commonly forms as a consequence of myocardial infarction, but it can be also caused by non-ischemic insults like myocarditis. These scars are composed of fibrous tissue with intervening cardiomyocytes, and because fibrous tissue is unexcitable, it represents a substrate for re-entry circuits leading to ventricular arrhythmia. As was true in this case, LGE in CMR is the gold-standard imaging for diagnosis of myocardial scar. Normal and viable myocardium appears black on LGE imaging while myocardial scar appears bright or enhanced. Myocardial scar detected on imaging is considered a strong predictor for cardiac death and major adverse cardiac events []. In our patient, the apical scarring was thought to be related to either HCM or less likely thrombotic or embolic event causing infarction in the distal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) territory given patient’s history of anti-phospholipid syndrome in setting of sub-therapeutic anticoagulation. It is thus important that the patient be continued on anticoagulation as he would be at risk for further embolic phenomenon. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy HCM is the most common cause of SCD in young athletes. It is mostly asymmetric with most cases having involvement of the basal inter-ventricular septum. However, hypertrophy can exclusively involve the apex, or mid-portion or posterior wall of the LV []. Diagnosis of HCM can be made by demonstrating a wall thickness > 15 mm in one more LV myocardial segments by any cardiac imaging modality, not explained solely by loading conditions []. Although the patient in this case has chronic kidney disease and hypertension, neither of these diseases can explain the LV hypertrophy demonstrated on the patient’s imaging as it is focal and asymmetrical (involving mid-segment of the inter-ventricular septum).\\\\nAlthough TTE is considered a good assessment tool for LV wall thickness and LV outflow tract pressure gradient, CMR should be considered for accurate assessment of LV wall thickness in patients with poorly visualized LV regions on echocardiogram, and particularly in HCM cases that are confined to one or two segments of LV like apical or anterolateral variants because of its superior characteristics including lack of attenuation, great spatial resolution in addition to its ability to image in any plane []. Also, LGE CMR plays an important prognostic role in predicting adverse cardiovascular events among HCM patients [].\\\\nThe CMR of Case 6 (Additional file CMR Link, ).', 'patient_id': '8015162-6', 'age': \"[[56.0, 'year']]\", 'gender': 'M', 'sentences': ['56-year-old male', 'antiphospholipid syndrome', 'chronic kidney disease stage III', 'essential hypertension', 'near syncopal episode', 'monomorphic ventricular tachycardia', 'hemodynamically stable', 'sinus tachycardia', 'T wave inversions', 'sub-therapeutic prothrombin time', 'international normalized ratio (INR)', 'trivial coronary artery disease', 'congenital coronary anomaly', 'LV apical aneurysm', 'mural thrombus formation', 'calcified nodule at cardiac apex', 'anomalous right coronary artery (RCA)', 'left coronary cusp origin', 'transmural course between aorta and pulmonary artery', 'mid-LV hypertrophy', 'apical LV aneurysm', 'apical mass suspicious for thrombus', 'full thickness scarring in LV apex', 'automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)', 'oral anticoagulation', 'antiarrhythmic therapy', 'Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)', 'mid-segment of inter-ventricular septum', 'LV wall thickness > 15 mm', 'chronic kidney disease', 'hypertension', 'LV outflow tract pressure gradient', 'CMR', 'LVEF of 60%', 'apical LV aneurysm measuring 3.']}\n","Finished report 3019\n","********************\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p'].

A new systolic ejection murmur was heard. Chest X-ray showed an abnormal aortopulmonary window with enlargement of the LA shadow. ECG showed P-mitrale (M-shaped P-waves) in lead II and biphasic P-waves in lead V1, suggesting LA enlargement (Fig. ). These results prompted a referral to pediatric cardiology. Physical examination revealed a dynamic precordium, a loud first heart sound, a II/VI systolic ejection murmur variable in intensity with inspiration, and an early, high pitched diastolic plop sound at the apex after the second heart sound. TTE (Additional file : Movie S35, Additional file : Movie S36) revealed a large, mobile, homogeneous mass in a dilated LA. The mass appeared to be pedunculated, but CMR was sought for further investigation.\\\\nThe cine bSSFP short axis view clearly demonstrates a large, smooth, pedunculated and mobile mass (Additional file : Movie S37). T1 with fat saturation and T2 imaging both showed hyperintensity (Fig. ). There was also hypointensity on first pass myocardial perfusion (Fig. ). All of the CMR findings were in keeping with a probable diagnosis of a benign myxoma []. On myocardial LGE (Fig. ) there was variable intensity, which could be an India ink artifact. With a higher inversion time, a myxoma would appear homogenous. Determining the diagnosis of a LA myxoma, exact location of the stalk, proximity of the myxoma to the pulmonary veins (Additional file : Movie S38), and the effects of the tumor on the mitral valve (Additional file : Movie S39) were integral in preparation for surgery.\\\\nIntra-operatively, after being placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, the LA tumor was resected through the RA by excising the fossa ovalis. The tumor measured approximately 6 cm x 4 cm (Figs. , ) with clear demarcation of the stalk’s attachment to the septum secundum and apex of the fossa ovalis between the pulmonary veins. An atrial septum repair with a pericardial patch was completed. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of a myxoma. The patient had an uncomplicated post-operative course and was doing well in follow-up at 1 year.\\\\nThis case demonstrates the importance of CMR in the diagnosis and management of cardiac tumors in children especially in the rare occurrence of a solitary tumor. In our case, the cardiac tumor was easily seen on TTE, but the actual diagnosis could only be suspected. CMR findings characterized the tumor as an atrial myxoma and although CMR has been shown to be highly accurate at differentiating between benign and malignant lesions, pathology remains the diagnostic gold standard []. Most importantly, CMR helped to pinpoint the location of the stalk, which was instrumental for complete resection of the tumor without collateral damage to the pulmonary veins or mitral valve.\\\\nCardiac tumors in children have a reported incidence of 0.027–0.08%, most of which are benign []. A differential for cardiac tumors may include: myxoma, fibroma, rhabdomyoma, malignancy, thrombus, teratoma, lipoma, and vascular tumors. CMR, along with the clinical correlation, are helpful tools when predicting the diagnosis of solid cardiac tumors. Location and different signal characteristics on commonly used CMR techniques of bSSFP, T1 and T2 fast spin echo, myocardial perfusion, and LGE are highly predictive of particular tumors. For example, a thrombus is often mural or intraluminal with hypointensity on all sequences [].\\\\nCardiac myxomas are often diagnosed in adults and presentation in children is very rare, generally presenting as part of a genetic syndrome [–]. Myxomas develop most commonly in the LA (60%), followed by the RA (28%) and rarely in the ventricles []. They typically arise near the fossa ovalis and more rarely from the atrial free wall close to the pulmonary veins or from the atrioventricular valves [].\\\\nThe uniqueness of this case stems from the patient’s young age and relatively benign presentation. Large myxomas, like the one in this patient, often present with systemic embolization, mitral valve obstruction or constitutional symptoms [, ]. An important consideration when children present with a cardiac myxoma is to screen for possible genetic causes i.e. Carney complex []. Carney complex is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome associated with pigmented lesions of the skin and mucosa as well as various types of myxomas and endocrine tumors []. The syndrome is due to mutations of the PRKAR1A gene in more than 70% of cases []. Other genetic causes are not well understood. Recurrence of the tumor is common in multiple and familial cases []. In this case, genetic testing revealed no syndrome as a cause for the myxoma.\\\\nThe CMR of Case 7 (Additional file CMR Link, ).', 'patient_id': '8015162-7', 'age': \"[[10.0, 'year']]\", 'gender': 'M', 'sentences': ['Asymptomatic 10-year-old male', 'Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder', 'Systolic ejection murmur', 'Abnormal aortopulmonary window', 'Enlarged left atrium', 'Large, mobile, homogeneous mass', 'Pedunculated mass', 'Smooth, large, mobile mass', 'Benign myxoma', 'Large, smooth, pedunculated mass', 'Atrial myxoma', '6 cm x 4 cm', 'Atrial septum repair', 'Pericardial patch', 'Cardiac tumors in children', 'Benign myxoma', 'Rare occurrence', '0.027–0.08%', 'Myxoma', 'Fibroma', 'Rhabdomyoma', 'Malignancy', 'Thrombus', 'Teratoma', 'Lipoma', 'Vascular tumors']}\n","Finished report 3020\n","********************\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p'].

An Asian male infant aged 18 days, born full-term, whose mother was asymptomatic and had immigrated to the United States from Pakistan 1 year earlier, developed a rash on his abdomen and chin. His primary care physician diagnosed staph pustulosis and discharged him. That night he developed a fever of 103°F (39.4°C) and did not wake to eat. The next morning, he was returned to the primary care physician, where he was febrile and referred to the emergency department. Laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) and blood urea nitrogen, and thrombocytopenia. Blood smear identified P. vivax parasites with <5% parasitemia. The infant was administered chloroquine PO in the hospital and IV antibiotics, including clindamycin, for the staph skin infection. The mother was counseled to obtain treatment for malaria with chloroquine and primaquine, although she has no record of a malaria diagnosis. The infant was discharged from the hospital after 4 days.\\\\nIn 2017, two cases of TTM occurred through blood transfusions in the United States.\\\\nRecipient 1. A report of this case and investigation was published (). A Black male aged 15 years with erythrocytapheresis-dependent sickle cell disease sought care in the emergency department for chest pain and malaise. He had no history of travel but had received monthly red blood cell transfusions, most recently, 24 days previously. He was discharged after an evaluation for acute chest syndrome but did not have the condition. Four days later, he was reevaluated for fever (100°F [37.8°C]) and back pain. At that time, during routine review of preerythrocytapheresis blood samples, ring trophozoite parasites were observed. Blood smear microscopy identified Plasmodium parasites with 0.5% parasitemia. Whole blood samples were sent to the state public health laboratory and were confirmed to be positive for P. falciparum and negative for Babesia microti. The patient did not have symptoms of severe malaria; he was treated with atovaquone-proguanil PO and recovered.\\\\nInvestigation 1. The blood center performed a traceback investigation of the donors and identified eight donors who provided red blood products to the recipient, all of whom were deferred from further donations pending the investigation. Five of eight collection tube segments, remaining from the initial blood product (which underwent dilution and processing), were available for testing. All eight donors were contacted to request a follow-up blood sample, of whom five provided a sample months after the initial donation. Altogether, seven of eight donors had specimens that were evaluated. Of the six donors’ specimens tested by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for the presence of malaria antibodies, five were negative for all Plasmodium species tested. Five of six donors’ specimens tested by PCR (nested and real-time PCR [RT-PCR]) had only negative results. The sole donor who had specimens test positive (by IFA and PCR) had a red blood cell segment sample and a fresh blood sample available for testing. The segment sample was positive by IFA for P. falciparum at a titer of 1:64 and had an RT-PCR cycle threshold value of 40.9 for P. falciparum, which is at the limit of detection. The follow-up whole blood sample was positive for P. falciparum by IFA at a dilution titer of 1:1,024. PCR was conducted four times on the whole blood sample from this donor (RT-PCR three times and nested PCR one time), and P. falciparum parasites were detected in one of four PCR tests. Because the donor specimen had low parasite density, performing extensive molecular genotyping to match the parasites between the recipient and donor was not possible. However, genetic marker analysis of merozoite surface protein 1 and merozoite surface protein\\\\n2 showed loci amplicon sizes of approximately 180 and 300 base pairs, respectively, for both the recipient and donor specimens.\\\\nDonor 1. The implicated donor in this case of TTM was an asymptomatic, first-time donor, born in West Africa. The donor questionnaire, which was completed in early 2017 at the time of the blood donation, showed that the donor denied being outside of the United States or Canada during the previous 3 years or ever having malaria. During the investigation, another interview determined that the donor had immigrated from West Africa in mid-2014 and had experienced previous episodes of malaria at unknown times. The donor was treated with atovaquone-proguanil PO for uncomplicated malaria.\\\\nRecipient 2. At the end of 2016, a White male child aged 14 months was admitted for respiratory failure that required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for 22 days in early 2017 and transfusion with 48 units of packed red blood cells. Approximately 1 month after the start of ECMO, the patient developed fever and was treated with multiple antibiotics, and while the blood cultures remained negative, fevers continued. The patient did not travel outside of his home state. Non-P. falciparum parasites were identified on thin and thick blood smears 1 week after fever onset. PCR was used to confirm infection with P. ovale. The patient was treated with chloroquine PO and primaquine PO and recovered.\\\\nInvestigation 2. The blood center identified 27 donors who contributed 48 units of packed red blood cells to the recipient in early 2017. All 27 donors were interviewed again by the blood center. Three donors were foreign-born (Iran, India, and Cameroon), and follow-up blood specimens were requested and obtained from the donors from Cameroon and Iran. The donor from Cameroon was considered highest risk because of travel within the last 3 years. IFA and PCR tests were negative for the donor originating from Iran. A specimen from the donor originally from Cameroon tested positive by IFA for P. falciparum and P. ovale (titers of 1:1,024 and 1:256, respectively). Whole blood from the Cameroonian donor was negative by PCR (two rounds of RT-PCR, one round of nested PCR). No other donor specimens were tested in this investigation.\\\\nDonor 2. The limited testing performed in this investigation suggests that the recipient’s malaria infection could have originated from the blood donor who had been in Cameroon within the previous 3 years. No additional details about the donor were provided to CDC by the blood center or health department. Whether the implicated donor was referred for antimalarial treatment is unclear.\\\\nThree cases were classified as cryptic in 2017.

The complete blood count (CBC) showed: white blood cells (WBC) 12.8 × 109/L, haemoglobin (Hb) 9.5 g/dL and platelets 144 × 109/L. The bone marrow (BM) showed AML with multilineage dysplasia (MLD). NPM1 mutation A and FLT3 wild-type were detected. The BM karyotype was normal. She was treated with a ‘7 + 3’ regimen, achieving a complete remission (CR) and 2.7 log reduction of NPM1 mutant transcripts at RT-qPCR (Fig. ). The patient then received two idarubicin/cytarabine-based consolidation cycles. In the following months, we observed a progressive increase of NPM1 MRD in the BM (Fig. ) that was rapidly followed by haematological relapse (15% blasts). A small FLT3-ITD subclone (0.5%) had also appeared. She received a combination of fludarabine, cytarabine, idarubicin and etoposide that led to CR and 1.7-log reduction of NPM1 transcripts (Fig. ). Allo-HSCT from an haploidentical donor was performed and she is now in molecular CR, almost 2 years after allotransplant (Fig. ).\\\\nOur patient showed AML with MLD (i.e. dysplasia in at least 50% of cells, in at least two BM cell lines []) and expression of cytoplasmic NPM1 in different haematopoietic cell lineages (Fig. ). MLD is one of the diagnostic criteria defining AML with myelodysplasia related changes (AML-MRC) but, according to WHO classification, when it coexists with NPM1 mutation, the genetic lesion supersedes morphology and the case should be diagnosed as NPM1-mutated AML [, , ]. Conversely, a previous history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or MRC-related cytogenetic abnormalities, even in the presence of NPM1 mutation, are diagnostic of AML-MRC []. Thus, our patient was diagnosed as NPM1-mutated AML since only MLD but no history of MDS or MRC-related cytogenetic abnormalities were documented.\\\\nMLD also helps defining the cell of origin of NPM1-mutated AML. Studies in mice suggest that NPM1-mutated AML may derive from a granulocytic-monocytic progenitor (GMP) []. We propose it may also originate from either a common myeloid progenitor (CMP) or a haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) (Fig. ), for the following reasons: (i) Erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lineages frequently show cytoplasmic NPM1 (Fig. ) or mutations in microdissected cells []; (ii) Precursors carrying NPM1 mutations with the immunophenotype of leukaemic stem cells (CD34 + /CD38-/CD123 + /CD33 + /CD90-) are present in BM of NPM1-mutated AML patients []; and (iii) Human NPM1-mutated CD34 + AML cells transplanted into NSG mice generate an AML recapitulating the original patient’s disease, with monocytic differentiation and loss of CD34 [].\\\\nBecause our patient belonged to the ELN favorable risk category (NPM1-mutated without FLT3-ITD) [], she received induction plus consolidation without allo-HSCT. In fact, patients with this genotype have <40% cumulative risk of relapse and high probability to achieve a second CR and to be salvaged by allo-HSCT. Allo-HSCT in first CR (CR1) has been proposed for patients <50 years, with low transplant-related risk and HLA-identical donor [], but this option remains investigational []. Thus, we only administered consolidation CHT.\\\\nMRD monitoring documented an early molecular relapse [] shortly followed by haematological relapse. The molecular relapse may have been heralded by the MRD suboptimal reduction after two cycles of CHT []. This could serve as another reasonable criterion for favoring allo-HSCT in CR1 [] in otherwise favorable risk NPM1-mutated AML according to ELN []. Currently, this issue is addressed in a multicenter, MRD-driven study on AML patients with favorable/intermediate-risk sponsored by Gruppo Italiano Malattie EMatologiche dell’Adulto, GIMEMA (NCT04168502). Sequential monitoring for MRD may allow pre-emptive intervention before haematological relapse [–].\\\\nThe emergence of a small FLT3-ITD subclone (0.5%) at relapse suggests clonal evolution towards a more aggressive AML. FLT3-ITD is an unstable mutation that may be lost (if present at diagnosis) or acquired at relapse. Interestingly, 4/6 NPM1-mutated AML patients with FLT3 wild-type at diagnosis who relapsed with FLT3-ITD (according to conventional PCR), harbored very small FLT3-ITD subclones already at diagnosis, when analyzed by a highly sensitive patient-specific RT-qPCR for FLT3-ITD [].\\\\nTherefore, the patient was treated with salvage CHT followed by allo-HSCT. She did not receive an FLT3 inhibitor since it was not approved at that time. Salvage CHT induced a new CR and about 2-log reduction in NPM1 transcripts. Although NPM1 MRD positivity before allo-HSCT has been associated with higher relapse rate [–], our patient is still in molecular CR almost 2 years after allotransplant.', 'patient_id': '8056374-1', 'age': \"[[58.0, 'year']]\", 'gender': 'F', 'sentences': ['58-year-old woman', 'urinary tract infection', 'white blood cells 12.8 × 109/L', 'haemoglobin 9.5 g/dL', 'platelets 144 × 109/L', 'bone marrow AML', 'AML with multilineage dysplasia', 'NPM1 mutation A', 'FLT3 wild-type', 'normal bone marrow karyotype', 'complete remission', '2.7 log reduction of NPM1 mutant transcripts', 'idarubicin/cytarabine-based consolidation cycles', 'progressive increase of NPM1 MRD', 'haematological relapse', 'FLT3-ITD subclone 0.5%', 'fludarabine/cytarabine/idarubicin/etoposide', 'complete remission', '1.7-log reduction of NPM1 transcripts', 'allo-HSCT from haploidentical donor', 'molecular CR', '2 years after allotransplant', 'cytoplasmic NPM1 expression', 'myelodysplasia related changes', 'AML-MRC diagnosis', 'NPM1-mutated AML', 'granulocytic-monocytic progenitor', 'common myeloid progenitor', 'haematopoietic stem cell', 'ELN favorable risk category', 'FLT3 inhibitor not approved', '']}\n","Finished report 3063\n","********************\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p'].

The BM was diffusely infiltrated by myelomonocytic leukaemic cells expressing cytoplasmic NPM1. Mutations of NPM1 (type A), FLT3-D835 and DNMT3A were detected. The BM karyotype revealed a trisomy 8 in about 20% of metaphases. Multiple light-purple skin nodules were found on clinical examination and a skin biopsy revealed dermal infiltration by leukaemic cells with cytoplasmic NPM1 (Fig. ). She received a ‘7 + 3’ regimen plus midostaurin, achieving haematological CR. Disappearance of FLT3-D835 mutation and a 3.8-log reduction of NPM1 mutant transcripts were observed (Fig. ). The patient received two cytarabine-based consolidation cycles plus a FLT3 inhibitor (midostaurin) achieving a maximum of 4.5-log reduction of NPM1 MRD (Fig. ); FLT3-D835 remained negative. In the following months, NPM1 MRD in the BM progressively increased (Fig. ), the patient remaining in haematological CR. No skin lesions were observed. She received pre-emptive therapy with venetoclax plus the hypomethylating agent (HMA) 5-azacytidine. She is now in molecular CR at the fifth cycle of this combo (Fig. ).\\\\nOur patient carried the D835 mutation involving the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of FLT3. Accordingly, we administered CHT plus midostaurin. The benefit of using this combo for the NPM1-mutated/FLT3-TKD genotype was shown in a recent study []. However, the best post-remission therapy for these patients (consolidation CHT vs allo-HSCT) remains controversial. In fact, FLT3-TKD mutations have been associated with favorable prognosis in some studies [–] but not in others [, ]. The NPM1-mutated/FLT3-TKD genotype in the RATIFY trial showed a 5-year OS rate of 70% []. Thus, patients receiving CHT plus midostaurin should be probably not allotransplanted in CR1 and we adopt this strategy.\\\\nThen, the question raises whether the early molecular relapse in our patient could have been related to the concomitant DNMT3A mutation. In fact, NPM1-mutated AML elderly patients co-mutated for DNMT3A seem to have high risk of relapse even though they achieve good molecular responses post-induction CHT. They should be considered for allo-HSCT or maintenance strategies, even if they belong to the favorable ELN risk group [].\\\\nNPM1-mutated AML co-mutated for FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A was initially recognized to display distinctive microRNA and epigenetic features []. The triple-mutated AML is clinically characterized by high WBC count, monocytic phenotype, absence of multilineage dysplasia, extramedullary involvement, normal karyotype and poor outcome [, , ]. Our triple-mutated patient carried FLT3-TKD instead of FLT3-ITD. Although it is difficult to make a comparison based upon only one case, she exhibited clinical and biological features similar to those of typical AML and responded poorly to CHT plus midostaurin. The introduction of more powerful FLT3 inhibitors may increase the percentage of triple-mutated patients who may be bridged to allo-HSCT. Preclinical studies suggest that triple mutated AML may be sensitive to venetoclax []. Our patient responded to pre-emptive therapy with venetoclax plus HMA, but this observation requires further clinical validation.\\\\nDid the trisomy 8 conditioned the suboptimal response to therapy in our case? About 15% of NPM1-mutated AML exhibit an abnormal karyotype [], usually characterized by +8, +4, -Y, del(9q) and +21, monosomy of chromosomes 5 and 7 and complex karyotype being very rare []. These aberrations represent secondary late events during the clonal evolution of NPM1-mutated AML []. Thus, trisomy 8 (as in our case) has no prognostic impact in NPM1-mutated AML []. Adverse-risk aberrations in NPM1-mutated AML include monosomy 7 or 5 or TP53 deletion []. However, cases with these genetic abnormalities would fill in the WHO category of AML-MRC.\\\\nSkin lesions, as in our patient, have been described in association with NPM1-mutated AML showing monocytic features []. Whether skin involvement represents a poor prognostic factor in the context of our patient’s genotype remains unknown. In a study including >3,000 AML patients, extramedullary disease did not show an independent prognostic value [] but mutational landscape was not investigated.

She achieved MRD-positive CR after the first cycle and is now in CR MRD-negative after five cycles of this combo.\\\\nWhat is the best treatment available for our patient? Venetoclax plus HMA or low dose cytarabine (LDAC), induced CR in 70–90% of NPM1-mutated AML patients [, ]. Similar dramatic responses have been also reported in NPM1-mutated myeloid sarcoma [, ]. Thus, the standard therapy for older unfit NPM1-mutated AML patients is now venetoclax plus HMA [, ]. CR is frequently achieved after one cycle and the regimen is usually well tolerated, with an early mortality of only 7% []. Nevertheless, patients experience a prolonged drug-related pancytopenia that should be differentiated from refractoriness to therapy by BM evaluation at appropriate time points. Persistent neutropenia may require prolonging intervals between cycles, reducing the duration of venetoclax administration per cycle or using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.\\\\nVenetoclax-based regimens have been also recommended as temporary alternative to intensive CHT in older fit NPM1-mutated AML patients during COVID-19 pandemic [, ]. MRD assessment may be particularly helpful under these circumstances, although the optimal time points for monitoring need to be established for this combo [].\\\\nVenetoclax plus HMA is also approved by the Italian Drug Agency as frontline therapy for fit AML patients ≥75 years old.

The CBC showed WBC 1.3 × 109/L, Hb 8.0 g/dL and platelet 25 × 109/L. The BM was diffusely infiltrated by monoblasts positive for macrophage-restricted CD68 and negative for myeloperoxidase and CD34. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of 43 genes detected a previously unnoted NPM1 mutation (see below), a rare FLT3 N841H mutation and two TET2 mutations. The BM karyotype showed a trisomy 8 in 4/25 metaphases. She received a ‘7 + 3’ induction, achieving CR. NGS after the first consolidation cycle showed disappearance of NPM1 mutation but persistence of FLT3-N841H. Parents asked for a consultation since allo-HSCT from the HLA-identical sister was proposed at another Institution.\\\\nNPM1 mutations are much less frequent in the childhood than in adults (about 7% vs 30%) []. Such a difference could be related to the fact that, in order to occur, NPM1 mutations require a background of clonal haematopoiesis (usually driven by DNMT3A and TET2 mutations) that is a very rare event in children but progressively increases with age []. NGS revealed a new NPM1 mutation (deletion of two nucleotides and an insertion of four nucleotides at position 864) leading to loss of tryptophans 288 and 290 and the creation of a putative nuclear export signal (NES) at the NPM1 C-terminus, both required for cytoplasmic dislocation of NPM1 []. Given the rarity of this NPM1 mutation, NGS and patient-specific RT-qPCR represent the best methods for MRD monitoring in this case.\\\\nWhat is the significance of the accompanying FLT3 and TET2 mutations in our patient? The FLT3-N841H mutation is located in the amino-terminal portion of TKD (activation loop of FLT3) and had previously reported only in one old patient with de novo AML FAB-M5 []. FLT3-N841H causes substitution of histidine for asparagine at codon 841 and leads to conformational changes of activation loop similar to substitutions of histidine for isoleucine (N841I) or tyrosine (N841Y) [] that were previously shown to have transforming properties. Notably, NGS analysis of BM sample in CR after the first consolidation cycle showed disappearance of NPM1 mutation but persistence of FLT3-N841H at 49% VAF. This finding raised the question whether the mutation was germline or related to clonal haematopoiesis []. Presence of FLT3-N841H in patient’s hair demonstrated its germline origin. The two mutations of TET2 were missense and most likely not pathogenetically relevant. The lack of impact of trisomy 8 in risk stratification of NPM1-mutated AML patients has been already discussed in case 2.\\\\nWhat is the best post-remission treatment for this young girl? Although the ELN stratification model [] mainly applies to adult patients age 18–60 years, NPM1 mutations appear to be a prognostic predictor even in children []. Because the FLT3-N841H mutation is germline and not functionally relevant, our patient should be assigned to the ELN favorable risk and receive only CHT without FLT3 inhibitors.

CBC showed WBC 43.3 × 109/L, Hb 3.5 g/dL and platelets 67 × 109/L. The BM was diffusely infiltrated by leukaemic cells with myelomonocytic (FAB-M4) appearance expressing cytoplasmic NPM1 (Fig. ) with no mutations at NPM1 exon 12; FLT3 was wild-type and the BM karyotype was normal. She received a ‘7 + 3’ induction regimen, achieving CR. We then administered two consolidation cycles with intermediate dose cytarabine and daunorubicin. She is now in CR, 6 years after the initial diagnosis.\\\\nNPM1 mutations almost exclusively affect exon 12 [] and all of them cause changes at the C-terminus of NPM1 (mutation of tryptophans and creation of a NES motif) resulting in enhanced nuclear export of NPM1 mutants and their aberrant accumulation in the cytoplasm of AML cells []. Very rare mutations involving exons 9 [], 11 [] and 5 [] also lead to cytoplasmic delocalization of mutant NPM1 through a similar molecular mechanism.\\\\nCytoplasmic expression of NPM1 (a surrogate for NPM1 mutations) can be detected by IHC in BM biopsies []. In our patient, the discrepancy between IHC (cytoplasmic NPM1) and conventional molecular analysis of exon 12 (absence of NPM1 mutation) prompted us to study the entire NPM1 coding sequence, revealing a mutation at exon 11 (Fig. ), similar to the one we previously described []. As expected, this mutation caused the loss of the two C-terminal tryptophans and the creation of a NES (Fig. ), explaining the abnormal cytoplasmic localization of NPM1.\\\\nIHC represents a valuable tool for predicting all NPM1 mutations []. NGS can also identify all NPM1 mutations but the commercially available panels are designed to recognize mutations at exon 12 only. Thus, they must be adapted for this purpose. Without IHC or NGS, cases like ours would be wrongly assigned to the ELN intermediate risk category (NPM1 wild-type without FLT3-ITD) rather than to the favorable risk group (NPM1-mutated without FLT3-ITD). Our patient had good outcome after CHT alone, suggesting that cases with exon 11 mutations may behave similarly to those with exon 12 mutations, but confirmatory studies are needed.

BM evaluation performed at another Institution was diagnostic of AML with 46,XY,t(9;22)(q34;q11)[9]/47,idem,+8[7]/46,XY[4]; a BCR-ABL1 rearrangement (p210 fusion) (Fig. ) and NPM1 mutation type B were detected (Fig. ), whilst FLT3 was wild type. Dasatinib was started at a different institution but discontinued after 2 weeks due to pericardial effusion. He presented at our Institution with WBC 2.3 × 109/L, Hb 7.8 g/dl and platelets 19 × 109/L. BM biopsy was massively infiltrated by myeloid (FAB-M2) blasts (Fig. ) expressing cytoplasmic NPM1 (Fig. ), indicating no response to dasatinib. Sequencing ABL1 exons 4–10 showed no mutations. A ‘7 + 3’ regimen induced partial response (10% residual NPM1 cytoplasmic-positive AML cells) (Fig. ). He was re-induced with fludarabine, cytarabine and idarubicin, achieving CR whilst fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed 0.5% of nuclei with BCR-ABL1. He underwent allo-HSCT from an HLA-identical sibling and is now in molecular CR for NPM1 and BCR-ABL1, 12 months after the allotransplant.\\\\nNPM1 mutations have been reported in de novo AML with BCR-ABL1 but not in chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic phase [–]. How should this patient be classified? In the 2017 WHO classification [], NPM1-mutated AML and AML with BCR-ABL1 represent a ‘distinct’ and a ‘provisional’ entity, respectively []. Therefore, NPM1 mutations supersede BCR-ABL1 and our case should be diagnosed as NPM1-mutated AML, annotating the presence of BCR-ABL1 []. Notably, leukaemic cells showed CD34 negativity that is more consistent with NPM1-mutated AML [] than with BCR-ABL1 AML []. The relative contribution of the two genetic abnormalities to leukaemogenesis remains to be established.\\\\nWhat is the prognostic impact of these genetic alterations? In the 2017 ELN model, AML with BCR-ABL1 is regarded as high-risk disease [] whilst NPM1-mutated AML without FLT3-ITD has a relatively good outcome []. ELN recommendations [] do not comment on the combination of NPM1 mutations and BCR-ABL1. Interestingly, two patients carrying NPM1 mutation and BCR-ABL1 were alive 36 and 71 months after diagnosis [], suggesting that they may behave more like a NPM1-mutated AML than as de novo AML with BCR-ABL1. However, further studies are required.\\\\nNPM1-mutated AML should be suspected in a middle-age or older patient who presents with M4-M5 morphology [], cup-like nuclei [] or multilineage involvement [] (case 1), a yet relatively preserved number of platelets despite high WBC count and negativity for CD34. Hyperleukocytosis usually associates with a concomitant mutation of FLT3 or RAS. A low WBC count does not exclude NPM1-mutated AML since cases with FLT3 wild-type may have this presentation, despite the BM tends to remain not hypocellular []. Independently of high WBC count, NPM1 or/and FLT3-ITD mutations may associate with disseminated intravascular coagulation []. Extramedullary involvement may occur [], especially in skin (case 2).\\\\nIn haematological centers performing BM biopsy at presentation, demonstration by IHC of cytoplasmic NPM1 may serve as surrogate to molecular techniques in case of dry tap or myeloid sarcoma [] (case 2). Moreover, as discussed in case 5, IHC could predict even rare NPM1 mutations occurring at exons other than 12 and even NPM1-containg fusion transcripts [].\\\\nConfirmation of diagnosis requires the identification of NPM1 mutation by Sanger or the more sensitive NGS technique (detecting 1–5% of mutated cells, depending on the allele coverage). NGS can also identify concomitant driver mutations, even within subclones. Identifying the exact type of NPM1 mutation [, ] is critical for setting-up the strategy of MRD monitoring (see below).\\\\nOnce a NPM1 mutation has been recognized, the definitive diagnosis of NPM1-mutated AML requires that other distinct and provisional AML entities of the 2017 WHO classification, such as AML-MRC (case 2), AML with BCR-ABL1 (case 6, Fig. ) and AML with RUNX1 mutations (Fig. ) are excluded. According to WHO 2017, the diagnosis of NPM1-mutated AML requires ≥20% BM blasts [] (Fig. ). However, the rare cases diagnosed as NPM1-mutated MDS show rapid transformation to AML [] and respond better to CHT than to HMAs [], suggesting that NPM1 mutations may define AML irrespective of blast percentage []. Similarly, NPM1-mutated chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) cases [, ] often carry a normal karyotype and tend to evolve rapidly to AML [], especially those with high NPM1 mutation allelic burden []. In our experience, they usually represent NPM1-mutated AML presenting with marked monocytosis.\\\\nOnce the diagnosis of NPM1-mutated AML has been established, the patient should be assigned to one of the ELN categories, either favorable (if FLT3 is wild-type or low ratio) or intermediate (FLT3-ITDhigh). Cases co-mutated for NPM1 and FLT3 should be possibly analyzed for DNMT3A to exclude the triple mutated genotype, which shows a particularly adverse outcome. As discussed in cases 1, 2, 3 and 4, risk stratification is important in guiding frontline (whether to use or not a FLT3 inhibitor) and post-remission therapeutic decisions (whether to perform or not allo-HSCT). Patient’s age and fitness are other important parameters to be considered for choosing between CHT and venetoclax-based regimens or for deciding whether to perform or not allo-HSCT.\\\\nAs discussed in cases 1 and 2, MRD monitoring (Fig. ) during and after completion of CHT + /- allo-HSCT is a critical step in NPM1-mutated AML []. In fact, progressive raising of MRD levels is a reliable predictor of impending haematological relapse [, , ]. Patients in molecular relapse (as case 2) are candidates for pre-emptive therapy [–], although it still remains uncertain whether converting pre-transplant MRD positivity into negativity is clinically relevant.

The patient presented at 37 weeks in active labor and advanced cervical dilatation. The tracing on admission was an atypical pattern of oscillations with a baseline rate of 140 bpm. Within three-hours of admission, the patient progressed to complete dilation, and with the first maternal push, the fetal heart rate abruptly dropped and remained at a rate of 50–60 bpm. A vacuum delivery was performed, and the infant was delivered 20 min following the onset of bradycardia. A small for gestational age infant (2200 g) had Apgar scores of 0, 4 and 5 at 1, 5 and 10 min, respectively.\\\\nWith resuscitation, a heart rate greater than 100 bpm was achieved at 4 min of age. The infant was noted to have a three-vessel cord, with a tight true knot in the cord. From the umbilical cord, only venous blood was obtained, demonstrating values of pH 7.10, pCO2 49 mmHg, pO2 35 mmHg and BDblood 15 mmol/L. At one-hour of life, an arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 6.8, pCO2 40 mmHg and pO2 89 mmHg. Laboratory results within an hour of life revealed a nucleated red cell count of 75 per 100 white blood cells, and elevated PT and PTT. A cranial ultrasound performed at 8 h of life demonstrated evidence of cerebral edema. At one-month of age, the infant demonstrated an abnormal MRI with basal ganglia injury.\\\\nAnalysis: The analysis of this case indicates an umbilical cord venous value that resulted in BDECF 12.9 mmol/L and a 1-hour arterial blood gas BDECF 25.2 mmol/L. The umbilical vein BDECF of 12.9 mmol/L (reflecting the fetal status prior to the bradycardia) suggests that the fetus already had significant acidosis prior to the onset of bradycardia. With 20 min of end-labor bradycardia, as a result of presumed complete cord occlusion due to the knot, the expected umbilical artery BDECF would be ~23 mmol/L. With a 4-minute resuscitation prior to the newborn heart rate of 100 bpm, the arterial BDECF would be 25 mmol/L. As the newborn does not significantly clear acid during the first hour of life, these values are consistent with the one-hour blood gas value BDECF 25.2 mmol/L.\\\\nThe findings of an atypical fetal heart pattern on admission, markedly elevated newborn nRBC count, an early onset coagulopathy and ultrasound evidence of cerebral edema by 8 h are further evidence consistent with a hypoxic injury occurring prior to presentation at the hospital. Finding of a tight knot in the cord both explains the intrauterine growth restriction and the fluctuating umbilical artery Doppler values (with the cord knot intermittently tightening and loosening). Although the end-labor bradycardia contributed to the newborn acidosis, the patient likely presented to the hospital with a significant fetal acidosis due to a preexisting hypoxic-ischemic event associated with the true knot, after which the knot may have loosened, and ultimately tightened again as the fetus descended in the pelvis with maternal pushing and labor progression.', 'patient_id': '8069793-1', 'age': \"[[32.0, 'year']]\", 'gender': 'F', 'sentences': ['32-year-old woman', 'gravida 4', 'para 3', 'intrauterine growth restriction', 'uterine artery Dopplers', 'active labor', 'atypical fetal heart pattern', 'small for gestational age', '2200 g', 'three-vessel cord', 'tight true knot', 'umbilical cord', 'venous blood', 'arterial blood gas', 'nucleated red cell count', 'elevated PT and PTT', 'cerebral edema', 'basal ganglia injury', 'acidosis', 'fetal status', 'complete cord occlusion', 'end-labor bradycardia', 'resuscitation', 'newborn heart rate', 'hypoxic injury', 'intrauterine growth restriction', 'fluctuating umbilical artery Doppler values']}\n","Finished report 3098\n","********************\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p'].

An initial cervical exam was 4 cm dilatation and 90% effacement. Upon the initiation of fetal monitoring, the tracing demonstrated a rate of 140 to 150 bpm with moderate variability. At 6 cm dilatation, rupture of membranes revealed thin meconium, though thick meconium was observed at the time of vaginal delivery. Throughout the remaining labor, the fetus demonstrated intermittent variable decelerations, though continued periods of minimal and moderate variability. At delivery, an infant female weighing 3685 g had Apgar scores of 1, 5 and 7 at 1, 5 and 10 min, respectively. Chest compressions were initiated for 3 minutes until a spontaneous heart rate over 100 bpm was detected. There were no umbilical cord blood samples drawn. Due to neonatal respiratory compromise, an endotracheal tube placed at one-hour of life though pulse oximeter values were not recorded. At two-hours of life, a capillary blood gas revealed pH 6.75, pCO2 129 mmHg, pO2 41 mmHg and BDblood 21.6 mmol/L, after which ventilator settings were modified. A chest X-ray revealed patchy infiltrates consistent with meconium aspiration syndrome. The infant subsequently developed encephalopathy and cerebral palsy.\\\\nAnalysis: As occurs commonly, physicians may not always obtain umbilical cord blood samples from infants in the immediate newborn period. However, the lack of confirmed cord values may raise questions as to the effects of the intrapartum course. In such cases, newborn blood gas values can be of great value. In the present case, fetal monitoring through the time of delivery demonstrating continued periods of minimal and moderate heart rate variability (consistent with fetal quiet and active sleep cycles) suggests that this was not an intrapartum hypoxic ischemic injury. Alternating minimal and moderate heart rate variability is consistent with fetal quiet sleep/active sleep cycling. After birth, chest compressions were discontinued prior to the 5-minute Apgar score indicating a rapid resuscitation. Due to respiratory distress, the infant was intubated at one-hour of life, though the capillary blood gas revealed marked acidosis at two-hours of age. Notably, the BDblood of 21.6 must be corrected for the markedly elevated capillary pCO2, resulting in a BDECF of 15.1.

During the course of labor, she had periods of moderate variable decelerations and alternating mild and moderate variability. One hour into the second stage of labor, there was an acute loss of signal of the fetal heart rate. Attempts to find the fetal heart tones with the monitor doppler revealed only intermittent brief signals of 105 bpm. A decision was made for a cesarean and the infant delivered operatively 26 min later. An infant female with Apgar scores of 3, 3, 4 and 7 at 1, 5, 10 and 15 min, respectively, had a venous umbilical cord gas of pH 7.50, pCO2 20 mmHg, pO2 65 mmHg, BDblood 7.3 mmol/L. The infant required cardiac compressions for 6 minutes, at which point the heart rate exceeded 100 bpm. An arterial blood gas was performed at 25 min of age, revealing pH 7.31, pCO2 20 mmHg, pO2 mmHg, 139, BDblood 14.7 mmol/L. The nRBC count was 10 per 100 white blood cells, and platelet count, PT and PTT were normal. The infant demonstrated hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.\\\\nAnalysis: The first step of analysis required inspection of the blood pH and gases. The venous gas at birth appeared to be contaminated or erroneous, as pH, pCO2 and pO2 values were not consistent with either physiologic umbilical artery or vein values. These values were consistent, however, with a venous sample exposed to an air bubble, either in the syringe or the blood gas analyzer. With air exposure, fetal pO2 values rose and pCO2 value dropped, and thus the pH rose. However, BDECF values did not change and the BDECF result could thus be utilized. With this understanding, the venous blood sample corrected to a BDECF 7.3 mmol/L (), while the arterial blood gas at 25 min of age corrected to a BDECF 14.7 mmol/L. The venous blood sample confirmed that the fetus had relatively normal base deficit at the onset time of a bradycardia. Based on a 6-minute neonatal resuscitation, the newborn increased base deficit by 3 mmol/L during the first six minutes and then remained stable from an acid-base perspective until the arterial blood gas was performed. Thus, the predicted arterial base deficit at 6 minutes of life was 14.7 mmol/L, and the calculated umbilical artery BDECF at delivery was ~11.7 mmol/L.\\\\nIf one “assumes” a continuous bradycardia for 26 min prior to delivery due to the loss of tracing, the umbilical artery to vein BD difference would be ~13 mmol/L. However, in the present case the difference of 4.4 mmol/L (11.7 minus 7.3 mmol/L) indicated that the fetus had a ~9-minute persistent bradycardia just prior to delivery. It is likely that intermittent variable decelerations beginning with the loss of signal increased fetal BD from a normal second stage BD value of ~4 mmol/L to 7.3 mmol/L, at which time the bradycardia occurred. The intermittent Doppler heart rate was consistent with maternal heart rate. These values demonstrate that the fetus had normal acid base status up until the loss of the fetal tracing and presumed bradycardia.

With an initial cervical exam of 6 cm dilatation and 100% effacement, she progressed rapidly to complete dilatation. The fetal monitor Doppler demonstrated a rate of 110 to 120 bpm with moderate variability and intermittent variable decelerations. With the first three pushes, the tracing demonstrated severe variable decelerations (decrease to ≤70 bpm, lasting ≥60 s) with minimal variability. Following a change in maternal position to left lateral, administration of oxygen and an intravenous fluid bolus, there was a break in the tracing continuity, after which the monitor demonstrated a baseline of 120 bpm, moderate variability and a pattern of accelerations during each maternal push. As the second stage progressed, the baseline increased to 140 to 150 bpm with scattered breaks in the tracings, through continued accelerations with pushing. Following a 1 h 40 min second stage, an infant delivered spontaneously with meconium staining and Apgar scores of 1, 2 and 4 at 1, 5 and 10 min, respectively. Umbilical artery blood revealed pH 6.93, pCO2 55 mmHg, pO2 18 mmHg, BDECF 18.5 mmol/L and umbilical vein blood demonstrated pH 7.00, pCO2 46 mmHg, pO2 27 mmHg, BDECF 17.7 mmol/L. The infant suffered hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and despite head cooling was ultimately diagnosed with cerebral palsy.\\\\nAnalysis: This case represents a situation where the fetal heart monitor shifted from a fetal to maternal (uterine artery) tracing. The change from severe variable decelerations with minimal variability to moderate variability and accelerations coincident with maternal pushing is highly suggestive of maternal heart rate recording. The increase in baseline is consistent with second-stage maternal heart rates []. Notably, fetal heart rate accelerations are uncommon during maternal pushes.\\\\nThe blood gases can provide insight into when the fetal BD exceeded a potential injury threshold of 12 mmol/L. The fetus normally enters the second stage with arterial BD 4 mmol/L. Severe variable decelerations increase BD by 0.5 mmol/L per minute [,], while placental BD clearance occurs at a rate of 0.1 mmol/L per minute. With four pushes every 10 min, repetitive severe variable decelerations would increase BD by 1.4 mmol/L every 10 min. The second stage of 100 min is thus consistent with the umbilical artery BDECF 18.5 mmol/L. The similarity of umbilical artery and vein BDECF values indicates there was not a predelivery persistent complete cord occlusion and bradycardia. Assuming the pattern of pushing (4 per 10 min) and severe variables continued throughout the second stage, the fetus likely exceeded BD 12 mmol/L at ~60 min into the second stage and thus would have had to be delivered prior to this time to assuredly prevent neurologic injury [].', 'patient_id': '8069793-4', 'age': \"[[27.0, 'year']]\", 'gender': 'F', 'sentences': ['27-year-old woman', 'gravida 4', 'para 3', '42 weeks pregnant', 'spontaneous labor', '6 cm dilatation', '100% effacement', 'fetal monitor Doppler', '110-120 bpm', 'moderate variability', 'intermittent variable decelerations', 'severe variable decelerations', 'oxygen administration', 'intravenous fluid bolus', 'left lateral position', 'meconium staining', 'Apgar scores', '1, 2, 4', 'umbilical artery blood', 'pH 6.93', 'pCO2 55 mmHg', 'pO2 18 mmHg', 'BDECF 18.5 mmol/L', 'umbilical vein blood', 'pH 7.00', 'pCO2 46 mmHg', 'pO2 27 mmHg', 'BDECF 17.7 mmol/L', 'hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy', 'cerebral palsy', 'uterine artery tracing', 'maternal heart rate recording', 'second-stage maternal heart rates', 'arterial BD 4 mmol/L', 'severe variable decelerations', 'placental BD clearance', 'umbilical artery BDECF values', 'predelivery persistent complete cord occlusion', 'bradycardia']}\n","Finished report 3101\n","********************\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p'].

She had been diagnosed a few years earlier as having SLE, presenting with 4 of 11 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria,[ including arthritis, pleuritis, high antinuclear antibodies (ANA) titers (1:1280), and elevated anti-dsDNA antibody titers. She was successfully treated with a few courses of IVIg and steroids for secondary myelofibrosis.[ Two months before admission, the patient had begun to receive 40 mg prednisone daily, which was continued throughout her admission. Upon admission, the patient was tachycardic, her blood pressure was 90/40 mm Hg, hemoglobin was 3.0 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count was 15.9 × 109/L and platelet count was 587 × 109/L. Both prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were within normal ranges and an electrocardiogram was unremarkable. Gastric suction demonstrated “coffee ground” appearance of the gastric contents. Angiography of the mesenteric vessels demonstrated a bleeding gastroduodenal artery. Consequently, embolization of the bleeding vessel, in addition to transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells were instrumental in stabilizing the patient's condition and achieving a hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL.\\\\nTwo days later, she developed a slow ventricular tachycardia and subsequently a ventricular fibrillation. After a successful resuscitation, she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where ST segment elevations were found in leads II, III, aVF, and V1–V6. Echocardiography demonstrated severe left ventricular dysfunction, with an akinesia that involved most of the left ventricle (LV) except for the basal segments. Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 20%. Creatine phosphokinase was 884 U/L (normal: 20–200 U/L) and its MB fraction was 147 U/L (normal: 5–25 U/L). A coronary angiography demonstrated normal coronary arteries. Hence, the differential diagnosis included acute myocardial infarction, either due to a thromboembolic event or vasculitis, vs myocarditis secondary to SLE. The patient refused to undergo cardiac biopsy. Therefore, the diagnosis of myocarditis was not proven histologically. The patient had no clinical signs of skeletal myositis.

Three days later, the patient was treated with nitrates, histamine receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, thiamine and her regular dose of prednisone (40 mg/day). In addition, high dose IVIg treatment was instituted: she received 0.5 g/kg IVIg per day for 4 consecutive days. Neither anticoagulants nor antiaggregates were added, because of the threat of recurrent massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Two days after IVIg treatment was initiated, an echocardiography revealed no significant change; whereas, 1 week afterwards, the estimated LVEF increased to 30%. Three days later, the LVEF increased to 40%. The echocardiographic changes were associated with the patient's subjective feeling of improvement, as well as objective signs such as normalization of blood pressure and complete normalization of her electrocardiogram (without the appearance of Q waves). There was no change in the ANA titer, while the erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased to 70 mm/h.\\\\nThe patient was discharged 2 days later, and follow-up echocardiography 1 month later demonstrated normal LV function, with an estimated ejection fraction of 55%.

Ten days after the first BC, he developed acute pulmonary oedema secondary to severe aortic regurgitation brought by a bulky aortic vegetation; hence the need for valve replacement.\\\\nNine isolates (#1.1 to #1.9) from the aortic valve sample were studied. MLST analysis showed that they all belong to the sequence type (ST) 97. However, virulome analysis revealed the absence of ebpA/B/C and srtC in isolates #1.1 and #1.2 (). As far as the resistome was concerned, three isolates, including the 2 isolates lacking ebpA/B/C and srtC, also lacked two aminoglycoside resistance genes, ant6-Ia and aph3′-III, as well as ermB, which is involved in macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance.\\\\nWe observed that a large sequence of 15,600\\u2005bp encompassing ebpA, ebpB, ebpC, and srtC was deleted within the genomes of isolates #1.1 and #1.2 ( and ).

The oral treatment with calcium carbonate and calcium citrate plus calcitriol was withdrawn without a decrease in calcium levels.\\\\nDuring the diagnostic work-up an ultrasound of the upper abdomen was performed and showed numerous hyperechoic solid formations of likely metastatic significance in the liver. Subsequently, total body CT confirmed the presence of multiple liver metastases, affecting 50% of the left hepatic lobe and 30% of the right lobe, and found a voluminous lesion with regular margins, sized 95 × 85 × 75 mm, in the pancreatic tail. Moreover, more metastatic implants, with a maximum size of 24 × 20 mm, were observed in the left subdiaphragmatic area. The patient was then subjected to liver biopsy, the histological examination revealed a liver localization of well differentiated NEN, Ki67 index 5%. Immunohistochemistry was positive for CK 8/18, CD56, synaptophysin, and weakly positive for CDX2 and chromogranin A. Among circulating neuroendocrine markers, calcitonin (958 pg/ml, normal values <10) and chromogranin A (470 ng/ml, normal values <100) levels were found elevated. The patient underwent 68Ga DOTATOC Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-CT which showed uptake of the radiotracer in the pancreatic lesion, and in hepatic and nodal metastases. Subsequently, he started therapy with Lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 28 days. Given the hypercalcemia, possibly of paraneoplastic origin, Denosumab 120 mg every 28 days was started.

Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for synaptophysin, chromogranin, neuron specific enolase (NSE), pan-cytokeratin, and calcitonin. One year later, therapy with somatostatin analogs (SSAs) was started due to onset of multiple liver metastases, and in 2010 Everolimus was introduced due to hepatic progression. Mild serum calcium elevation appeared in 2014, with normal renal function, PTH, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Neck ultrasound, performed for follow up of a multinodular goiter, revealed a hypoechoic lesion resembling a parathyroid adenoma. Serum calcium levels progressively increased (11.8 mg/dl normal range 8.4–10.2 mg/dl), thus Cinacalcet was introduced at the dosage of 30 mg/daily and increased up to 60 mg/daily. However, it was withdrawn because of its inefficacy. No evidence of disease progression was recorded, but clinical conditions rapidly deteriorated, and hypercalcemia was treated with intravenous saline hydration and loop diuretics to obtain rapid restoration. Subsequently, intravenous bisphosphonate Zoledronate was introduced, 4 mg monthly for 12 months (from October 2018 to October 2019) with normalization of calcium levels. PTH levels remained within normal reference range, while neck ultrasound did not confirm the suspected parathyroid lesion. Clinical and biochemical results strongly support the hypothesis of a hypercalcemia ascribable to a secretion of PTHrP, since all other causes of hypercalcemia were excluded, but unfortunately the assay for PTHrP was not available.

One month before she arrived at our medical facility the patient went to the emergency room of another hospital because of the onset of neurologic symptoms (psychic slowdown, confusional state, sensory dullness). Emergency room blood exams showed severe hypercalcemia (21 mg/dl). The patient was hospitalized in the nephrology unit where she underwent hemodialysis (single treatment), bisphosphonates injections, and continuous infusion of calcitonin to control hypercalcemia. Neoplastic mass embolization through spirals positioning in the splenic artery was performed. Calcium levels normalized in a few days and at the same time a gradual improvement of neurologic symptoms was observed until a complete recovery. Imaging studies showed a 12 cm mass of pancreatic body and tail. A needle biopsy of the mass was diagnostic for a well differentiated NEN. 111In-pentetreotide scan was performed and showed tracer uptake in the abdominal lesion. Patient was discharged and referred to our hospital for further investigations and surgery. When the patient arrived at our facility her calcium levels were between 8.5 and 8.7 mg/dl (normal). Diabetes and anemia requiring blood transfusions were observed. Hormonal examinations showed low-normal PTH levels (12 pg/ml, normal values 10–90), high levels of calcitonin (3,079 pg/ml, normal values 0.10–15.00) and chromogranin A (222 UI/l, normal values <20). Vitamin D metabolites were determined showing low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (8 ng/ml, normal values >20) and high levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (85 pg/ml, normal values 16.0–55.0). An abdomen MR confirmed an expansive 12 cm lesion of the body and tail of the pancreas, highly vascularized, with a central necrotic area, with apparent infiltration of the fundus of the stomach and the splenic ileum, and showed thrombus of the splenic vein jutting out within the portal mesenteric confluence.

Due to the occurrence of metastatic disease on the right maxillary sinus, from October 2008 to January 2009, he received first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (CVD regimen) and radiotherapy (total dose administered was 30 Gy in 7 fractions), with a good local control of disease. In May 2009 and August 2012, the patient underwent surgical resection of isolated subcutaneous metastases on the back and axillary region, respectively. From July to September 2014, due to the spread of subcutaneous metastases to the upper and lower limbs, the patient was treated with ipilimumab; he obtained a stable disease as best response. This response was maintained until July 2015 when a subcutaneous, soft tissue, bone and pulmonary progression of disease occurred. In August 2015, due to the presence of BRAF mutation, treatment with the BRAFi dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) and the MEKi trametinib (2 mg once daily) was started. Treatment was well tolerated except for recurrent episodes of grade 2 hyperpyrexia (with body temperature as high as 40.0°C) not resolved by temporary dabrafenib ± trametinib discontinuation and finally leading to progressive dose reductions (lower dose schedule: dabrafenib 50 mg twice daily and trametinib 1 mg once daily). At the first radiological examination with 18F-FDG-PET, a partial response in the lungs, soft tissues and right maxillary sinus was documented with stable disease in the bone. The response lasted 19 months until March 2017, when the treatment was discontinued due to progression of the right maxillary sinus lesion and of subcutaneous lower limb metastases. From March to July 2017, the patient received six infusions of the anti-PD-1 antibody (pembrolizumab), followed by systemic progression of disease on all metastatic sites and the appearance of a single brain lesion, for which he received stereotactic radiation. Between September and November 2017, the patient was treated with a single agent, dacarbazine, with progression of disease on the right maxillary sinus and with the appearance of a new brain lesion in the temporal lobe. As further new treatment options were not available, and clinical conditions were good (ECOG PS 0–1), in December 2017, the patient resumed treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib and received stereotactic radiation in a single fraction on the new brain lesion. LDH value at the time of the start of treatment was high [>1 to <2 × upper normal limit (UNL)]. Due to previous severe dose-limiting hyperpyrexia in concomitance with the same agents, the dose of dabrafenib was ab initio reduced to 75 mg twice daily while maintaining the full dose of trametinib (2 mg once daily). The first radiological evaluation with computed tomography (CT) scan in May 2018 showed a partial response in the brain, lungs and right maxillary sinus lesions and a stable disease for bone metastases.

After 34 months of rechallenge, at the time of this report, treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was being continued: at the last radiological evaluation with a CT scan in November 2020, partial response in all disease sites, including the maxillary lesion was maintained.

Symptoms had worsened in the last 72 h before admission. On admission, the patient was placed on a non-rebreather mask (NRB) at 11 L/min (LPM) due to respiratory distress, which partially improved hypoxia from SpO2 81 to 91%. Three days after admission, the respiratory status worsened revealing diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacification on chest CT scan, along with increased counts of neutrophils in plasma, lymphopenia, and transaminitis. Labs showed increased ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (), features compatible with the cytokine release-like syndrome associated with COVID-19 (, ). Based on his clinical condition with pending COVID-19 testing results, the patient was started on albuterol, meropenem, hydroxychloroquine, ascorbic acid, thiamine, TCZ, and enoxaparin prophylaxis. One day later, due to decreased oxygen saturation, the patient was placed in pronation. Upon worsening hypoxia, severe dyspnea, positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 swab testing, and meeting the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the patient was intubated. Furthermore, prophylactic enoxaparin was switched to intravenous (IV) heparin 1,500 U/h, and an IL-1 inhibitor (anakinra) was started. Shortly, a vasoplegic shock refractory to adjustments in sedative medications prompted onset of vasopressors (norepinephrine). Since admission, the patient had no bowel movements despite the use of laxatives (lactulose), prokinetics (metoclopramide), and enemas (saline laxative). Progressive abdominal distension warranted a CT scan demonstrating extensive colon and small bowel pneumatosis with mesenteric and portal venous gas, raising suspicions of bowel ischemia (). Based on the patient's clinical and pathological characteristics, lactate levels of 2.0 mmol/L, and no increased vasopressor requirement, surgical resection was not considered the best course of action at the time. Laxative regimen was enhanced with polyethylene glycol and senna. Monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure ranged from 13 to 19 mmHg, which suggested a likely abdominal compartment syndrome (). Six days after initiation of mechanical ventilation, the patient developed non-oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI) likely secondary to COVID-19 sepsis and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hemodynamic instability. The patient was approached in a conservative, non-surgical fashion including switching propofol to ketamine, adjusting IV fluids, using piperacillin–tazobactam for enteric bacteria, and holding potential nephrotoxic agents. A repeated CT scan 12 days after the initial scan showed changes consistent with bowel ischemia, as well as signs suggestive of peritonitis, complicated by bowel perforation, pneumoperitoneum, small bowel obstruction (SBO), enterocutaneous fistulas, and abscess formation. Additionally, the patient developed hematochezia and melena, requiring aggressive resuscitation, including multiple blood and frozen plasma transfusions, as well as repeated drainage procedures to address the intra-abdominal collections. Noteworthy, a CT angiogram ruled out active bleeding at the time of melena and hematochezia. The patient slowly and progressively recovered and was finally discharged for rehabilitation, 90 days after admission. In a delayed fashion, he underwent a right colectomy.
